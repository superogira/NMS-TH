{The educational program teaches me some of the language of the warriors!}
{The animated blob senses my withdrawal from the terminal. It has been programmed to start crying at this point.}
{A biological probe antenna launches from the terminal and fuses with my exosuit. I can't move. There's no way to tell if this is a normal function, or a security measure.}
{Interloper electrification initializing! Punishment commencing!}
{Escape}
{Wait}
{I use my jetpack's propulsion to break the probe. It contains something useful...}
{The probe becomes electrified. The smell of burnt flesh spreads up into my visor.}
{The alarm hasn't disrupted the factory's production line. Resources are being drawn from the vaults below me, but they have run dry. I could obtain whatever the mechanisms are creating with the right element...}
{Grah! Gek war preparation disrupted! Ammunition production stalled! Metal required!}
{Insert metal}
{Insert organic matter}
{Insert catalyst}
{The war factory's work is allowed to continue. I reap my reward.}
{I hear the sound of the manufacturing process imploding with my contribution. The war factory grinds to a halt.}
{Elements are being stockpiled. Storage vaults have been filled by local warriors. There's still space for a metal, but my scanner can't tell which one...}
{Gek war approaches! Scarce elements required! High Command demand chromatic metal! Contribute warrior!}
{Insert pure Ferrite}
{Insert magnetised Ferrite}
{Insert Chromatic Metal}
{An automated bark of thanks is played. I receive a reward.}
{An automated bark of confusion is played. My contribution goes unrewarded.}
{A warrior has booby-trapped the terminal. The security alert has triggered the timer on an explosive charge. There are two wires exposed. The warrior has left a note. Only seconds remain...}
{Grah! Pathetic interloper! Honourable warning: cut red wire? Certain death!}
{Cut red wire}
{Cut blue wire}
{Move back}
{The explosion takes the terminal out of action, and almost me with it.}
{The bomb is defused. Operations are restored.}
{I move away just in time. The terminal is damaged and inoperable.}
{A secondary security sweep is underway. Scanners emerge from the ceiling and start to pan towards where I stand. If they detect me the facility will go into a full lockdown...}
{Security scan initializing! Motion detection cameras operational!}
{Move to hiding spot}
{Stand still}
{The scanners detect me ducking down to hide. The facility becomes offline.}
{The scanners pass over me. Their sweep concludes. The installation remains operational.}
{A warrior's heart is on-screen. It is connected to wires and artificial valves. It pumps a biological liquid through harvested organs deep within the facility. Its beat is irregular. It has been compromised by the security alert.}
{Intruder alert! Battle enzyme production halted! Electrical charge removed from body harvest circuit!}
{Increase electrical flow}
{Initiate adrenalin flux}
{Power down systems}
{The heart's beat is maintained. Its strange existence continues. The facility remains online.}
{The heart beats faster, but then suddenly beats no more. The terminal dies with it.}
{The terminal goes offline. The body organs that relied on its processes are starved of oxygen, and die.}
{The alert has obscured the information on the primary terminal. I can only make out a few words. If I can work out what was being worked on here, I can restart the workflow – and restore operations.}

{The facility's production harvest is underway. I can speed up systems by boosting some of the machinery operating below me. What appears to be a power management screen is open on the terminal...}
{POWER REPORT. Electromagnetic coil: charge falling. Power core: acceptable boundaries. Primary motherboard: levels high.}
{Boost power core}
{Boost primary motherboard}
{Boost electromagnetic coil}
{The security alarm hasn't impacted production. Below my feet unseen equipment prepares the mineral harvest. I can speed up the process by eliminating unnecessary systems. The on-screen automated report will help...}
{SUBSIDIARY SYSTEMS. Temporal capacitor: operational. Central AI core: operational. Gravitational stabilisers: unscheduled drain, disconnection advised.}
{Remove temporal capacitor}
{Remove central AI core}

{Reconfigure laser refraction}
{Reconfigure laser-assisted replication}
{Reconfigure laser beam integrity}
{The noise of gas being flushed through systems beneath my feet can be heard over the noise of the alert. An automated report flashes onto the terminal. I can use it to boost production speed, and hopefully maintain it.}
{GAS INTEGRITY REPORT. Distribution network: full efficiency. Storage tank: breach detected. Pressure valves: operational.}
{Rebalance distribution network}
{Rebalance storage tank}
{Rebalance pressure valves}
{A faint chill can be felt while the security alert sounds. Coolant pipes are flushed, and an automated report appears on-screen. I can use its findings to boost the production cycle, and maybe maintain it.}
{COOLANT OVERVIEW. Coolant chamber: full. Coolant pump hydraulics: operational. Coolant network: suspected blockage, reduced operations. Engineer notified.}
{Repair coolant chamber}
{Repair coolant pump}
{Repair coolant network}
{An off-world command priority has stalled all processes within this installation. The terminal blinks angrily with a demand for urgent action on an unpaid debt. There is an option to reply with currency attached. I get the impression someone's life would get a lot easier if I'm feeling charitable...}
{Gek Trade Federation fury! Planetary installation tax unpaid! Initiate repayment!}
{Pay full amount}
{Pay partial amount}
{A remotely-operated scent dispersal system bathes me in a pleasant perfume. The terminal unlocks something that will aid my travels.}
{An angry alien beak momentarily appears on a terminal and shouts at me. Limited systems within the facility are back online.}
{Images of fighter-class starships have been sent here. They bare scorch-marks from battle, and are most likely pirates. The message seems to ask for witnesses, and there's some form of reward for replies...}
{Gek Trade Federation warning. Pirate activity detected. Report sightings!}
{Tag some ships}
{Tag all ships}
{An instant reply comes through with a small monetary reward!}
{A worried response comes through with a reward for my report.}
{A mass-mailed corporate message sits unread on the terminal. It is full of high numbers and seemingly impressive profit margins. The tone seems satisfied, and grateful. At its foot the employee can choose between one of two images: a galactic unit banking account, or a full hold of cargo.}
{Friend! Gek Trade Federation announces high profit! Choose units or product recipe reward!}
{Choose unit account}
{Choose ship's cargo}
{An automatic scent dispenser sprays me with a pleasant perfume when it opens. I receive funds from the message's senders.}
{A nearby storage vault opens. I receive trade goods.}
{There is a message from a distant alien race. They sound angry with the trader who's logged into the system. I can send them one of two on-screen metallic products. The first looks oddly faint in colour, and the second shimmers brightly on-screen.}
{Scurrilous Gek Trader! Gek offer impure matter! Vy'keen destroy Gek! Units withheld!}
{Send faintly-coloured metal}
{Send brightly-coloured metal}
{The voice of an angry warrior screams through the intercom. Nothing else happens.}
{A noise of gruff acceptance is heard over the intercom. A payment is released.}
{The screen shows that a lot of elements are exchanged here, but right now the trading vault is open... and empty. An off-world message, perhaps related to this, flashes on-screen.}
{Friend! Gek Trade Federation demand uncommon metal elements! High units offer!}
{Put common metal into trading vault}
{Put uncommon metal into trading vault}
{Put rare metal into trading vault}
{I receive a small payment.}
{I receive a generous payment.}
{I receive a decent payment... ... and a surprised note of thanks.}
{I discover an excited message from off-world. It seems to be discussing a report with... an image of me at its centre! Someone seems intrigued by my journey, and may well want to help. Should I get in touch?}
{Unknown lifeform research is HIGHLY commendable Entity! Discuss data with Korvax Convergence immediately!}
{Delete report}
{Open comms}
{The report is wiped from the system. An off-world message appears briefly. It seems disappointed.}
{I briefly see mask lights staring out at me before the comms feed is cut. The terminal rewards me with valuable knowledge.}
{I find a report filled with images of Sentinels, but its upload seems to have stalled. A demanding, perhaps rude, off-world message flashes at me. Somebody, somewhere, wants something.}
{Ahem. Planetary Sentinel scan data? UPLOAD SENTINEL SCAN DATA, ENTITY! IMMEDIATELY!}
{Resend Sentinel data}
{Reply with a refusal}
{The information packet is uploaded, and payment appears instantaneously.}
{Bright red mask lights appear and scream in angry binary.}
{A hollow metallic mask emerges. It's a data extraction device for electronic lifeforms, and my head can just about fit inside. A higher power could perhaps hear my needs and desires. Arcs of electricity crackle over its surface. If I risk this, it could hurt...}
{Entity! The Korvax Convergence is dissatisfied! Your neural netway cortex upload is late!}
{Use while thinking about my journey}
{Use with a clear mind}
{Leave well alone}
{The pain is unbearable. I see into the heart of... the Korvax convergence. It rewards my experiences.}
{The creatures stare into the depths of my mind. The pain is indescribable, but I am thanked.}
{I cautiously back away from the alien device.}
{A mass-mailed off-world message shows damaged electronic lifeforms. Arms are ripped off, masks chewed and facial lights dimmed. It feels offensive. It's clearly intended to shock recipients into a response. Replies can be sent with units attached...}
{Korvax friend! Dangerous creatures attack Korvax Entity! For weaponry sales contact Gek Trade Federation today!}
{Reply with units}
{Reply with outrage}
{Do not reply}
{I paid for a new multi-tool to protect me.}
{I receive no reply. But someone else appreciates me...}
{I leave the distasteful message unanswered.}
{I open an unread off-world message. It's an important choice for the research station operator to make. There are three clear images that I can choose from on behalf of the absent electronic lifeform: dangerous-looking predators, a geological mining survey and an orbiting asteroid cluster. It seems the decision will be rewarded in some way...}
{Entity! Clarify your next research topic immediately! Korvax Convergence technology advance imminent!}
{The predators}
{The mining survey}
{The asteroid cluster}
{I receive a new multi-tool.}
{I receive a multi-tool technology blueprint.}
{I receive a ship technology blueprint.}
{I open a list of military achievements that's waiting for upload. There are images of distant battles, bloodied robots and vast explosions. A covering note clearly expects something in return, but the author chose not to send it.}
{Grah! Old honourable warrior retires! Death! Death! Warrior remuneration!}
{Send war record}
{Edit war record}
{Celebratory barks and howls spill from audio speakers. I take the warrior's reward.}
{I amend the war record with colourful nonsense and send it.  The terminal flashes as it records my image.}
{Military insignia and images of recently destroyed Sentinels fill the screen. Alien propaganda imagery takes glory in the destruction. I can respond with a numerical value, and nothing else.}
{Grah! Vy'keen High Command demands your Sentinel kill count!}
{Input a huge number}
{Input a small number}
{Input a zero}
{A strange, strangled military fanfare starts playing. Someone impressed by my claims sends through a reward.}
{A small reward payment is sent through the facility's systems.}
{An angry warrior's face screams at me from the screen. A security laser appears from the ceiling and takes its best shot.}
{I find an image of a young warrior. The picture makes it look virile and impressive. Its tendrils are outstretched. It looks rich, and of good breeding stock. The look in its eyes is... sultry? The message gives me two options.}
{Grah! Pathetic warrior! You displease my ancestors! Accept my offspring mating proposition! Accept dowry tribute!}
{Accept}
{Refuse}
{Speakers throughout the facility play orchestral music. I receive a generous gift.}
{A warrior elder appears on-screen and curses me.}
{I find a picture of a deserted plain, a diagram of two aliens in combat and images of a chosen form of multi-tool weaponry. The images then seem to show the weapon locked inside a planetary trading vault... The message sounds angry, and as if one of these creatures occupies the moral high ground. I can accept, or refuse.}
{Grah! Pathetic coward! Face my duel challenge! The chosen weapon is in your facility! Death! Death!}
{Accept}
{Refuse}
{Dramatic music plays. The storage vault opens, with a multi-tool inside.}
{I hear an angry ranting alien through the terminal speakers.}
{A huge list of equipment is waiting to be sent off-world. It's a stock list of some sort: everything has been confirmed and ticked off.}
{Grah! Gek war approaches! Vy'keen High Command request weapon reserve inventory! High Command send missing equipment!}
{Send stock list}
{Uncheck one item and send}
{Uncheck many items and send}
{I receive units and thanks.}
{Warrior High Command sends me a multi-tool technology blueprint.}
{Warrior High Command is displeased. An angry General bellows at me and electrifies the facility.}
{I find an off-world message intended for a creature posted in this station. It's oddly sentimental. Images of an infant warrior can be seen, then a picture of the same creature as a bloodied adolescent – proudly biting into the throat of a hoofed beast. In the final image a young warrior salutes its family as it leaves a distant world. There are two locked storage vaults at my feet. The message is programmed to release only one...}
{Grah! Today child experiences Vy'keen war ceremony! Tradition demands gift! Aggression left, defence right! Enemy blood! Death! Death!}
{Choose the storage vault on the left}
{Choose the storage vault on the right}
{A contented snarling sound plays. The vault contains an exosuit technology blueprint.}
{A contented snarling sound plays. The vault contains a multi-tool technology blueprint.}
{Someone is building a nuclear warhead. The plans that have been set in motion are unmistakable. A complicated sequence of technology blueprints and isotopic chemical reactions is waiting for the final addition of Thamium9 to be complete. There are countless lives on an unknown planet, far out in the cosmos, that could one day end due to this war factory's work...}
{Grah! Vy'keen war preparation nears completion! Death to the unsuspecting Gek!}
{Complete warhead manufacture}
{Attempt to deconstruct warhead}
{The face of a delighted warrior appears on-screen. The factory's trade vaults unlock.}
{I salvage a technology blueprint from the warhead.}
{An off-world message has been sent here from a species of beaked traders. It looks like a signed contract, or maybe some sort of treaty. In response several offerings of valuable trade goods have been left in a vault by local warriors for exportation. Warrior High Command has sent a subsequent message to explain...}
{Grah! Foolish, pathetic, ignorant Gek Trade Federation believe peace treaty! Warrior give trade to pacify! Death soon!}
{Give trade goods}
{Take trade goods}
{The Trader species thanks me from afar. I am sent units to pacify me further.}
{I remove the offerings. Diplomatic relations between two species are destabilised.}
{This appears to be a staging post for an imminent military operation. On-screen plans show a trading ship that carries a very particular sort of cargo, that's perhaps intended to persuade a distant planetary authority to allow the craft through their checkpoints. Covertly, however, the craft has been heavily modified – and also carries a phalanx of warriors carrying enhanced multi-tool technology. I can request further details on several aspects of the plan before I am detected, and shut out of the system.}
{Grah! Gek homeworld covert ops mission initiated! Surprise war! Death! Death! High command send equipment! Request! Request!}
{Investigate details of the cargo}
{Investigate details of the trade ship}
{Investigate details of the multi-tool}
{I receive the product blueprint of the cargo being used in the covert ops mission.}
{I receive a technology blueprint used by the covert ops ship.}
{I receive a technology blueprint used in the multi-tools of the covert ops mission.}
{This is a brand new manufacturing plant with no assigned specialty. The terminal is entirely blank, and is running automated start-up procedures. I have to flick through several screens before a pictorial message appears. There are three chemical symbols – one a catalyst, and the others organic and metallic . Production processes warm up around me, waiting for a template to work from.}
{Trade federation friend! Product recipe unselected! Gek Trade Federation lose units!}

{The trade vaults in this installation are full to the brim, and ready for distribution. There are three images on-screen, each showing the outline of a different sort of trader. It's strange... it's as if they're put in order of the size of their gut. The first trader is small and sleek, the second is pudgier – and the final has a huge belly that almost drags on the floor. I'm clearly meant to choose one...}
{Rejoice! Vy'keen war reparations arrive! Elder large Gek receive high reward! Low toilgek receive low reward!}
{Choose the small, sleek trader}
{Choose the medium-sized trader}
{Choose the obese trader}
{A trade vault opens. I receive a cursory amount of trade goods .}
{A trade vault opens I receive a decent amount of trade goods.}
{A trade vault opens. A huge amount of trade goods is made available}
{An important message has been received from off-world. A holographic overlay shows various interstellar trade routes, but each one ends abruptly – long before their destination is reached. There are goods waiting in a locked trade vault for transportation. I can select the final destination, or I can select one of points at which a ship has disappeared.}
{Gek Trade Federation warning! Vy'keen hostility? Captain! Complete trade mission, or investigate disappearance?}
{Select trading destination}
{Select disappearance location}
{The trade vault unlocks.}
{I receive a ship technology blueprint to aid in my protection.}
{This whole facility beams out some kind of suppression field over the planet's surface. It's dampening some unknown form of communication, and clearly seen as a vital and necessary operation by the traders that operate here. The suppression field is powered by catalytic elements, fed into the system by the unlocked resource vault that's at my feet.}
{Despair! First spawn monolith awake! Unknown culprit! Strengthen suppression field!}
{Remove catalyst}
{Add catalyst}
{I take the trade goods. The suppression field powers down.}
{The suppression field is strengthened. A message of relief appears on-screen.}
{Images of warrior ships fill a transmission that loops on the terminal. They dwarf small trader ships as they pass by, like predatory fish innocuously swimming amongst their prey. There is a definite feeling of tension in the scene. Trade, storage and resource vaults around me are clearly being used to store different sorts of defensive and offensive devices. The time is perhaps coming when this race of traders will be called upon to fight.}
{Despair! Vy'keen hostility! Treaty breach! Arm yourself! Trade vaults: multi-tool. Storage vaults: technology! Resource vaults: ammunition!}
{Open Trade vault}
{Open Storage vault}
{Open Resource vault}
{I am armed with a new multi-tool.}

{I receive ammunition.}
{An image of a distant solar system is being studied here. A mineral-rich moon can be seen, orbiting a desolate and toxic-looking planet. Slightly obscured in the background, meanwhile, is a strange dark-coloured smudge – a diamond shape floating in space. A hint of red flashes from its centre. There are no coordinates visible, but I can enhance different parts of the image to study them and automatically upload the terminal's findings.}
{Atlas Interface awakes? Upload research findings immediately entity! Korvax Convergence sends relevant research technology!}
{Enhance moon image}

{My research uploads. I receive a ship technology blueprint to aid my studies.}
{An off-world message to all planetary research stations has filled the screen with plans for a scientific expedition of some sort. Complex star charts, fuel requirements, complex communication rigs and plans for orbital experiments fill the screen. The outpost's resource vault is open to contributions of metals for the cause, while it also appears that the resident scientist could join the fleet... although it would require an upgraded ship.}
{Research entity! Atlas Interface mission begins! Donate contribution! Specialists apply here! Convergence sends specialists ship technology!}
{Contribute a metal}
{Join team}
{My contribution is accepted. Useful knowledge is made available, with thanks.}
{The scientist's application is accepted. A ship technology blueprint is made available.}
{This outpost seems to be a vast library of production knowledge. A vast list of product formulas endlessly scrolls on the terminal, moving so fast that it hurts just to look at them. They appear to be catalogued by their base elements, but any deeper inspection makes me feel nauseous. The resource vaults next to me are open, and are clearly in regular use.}
{Korvax Convergence product catalogue available. Insert element to filter product catalogue.}
{Insert catalyst}
{Insert organic matter}
{Insert metal}
{The terminal uses the element to isolate and select a reward.}
{The terminal uses the element to isolate an oxide reward.}
{The terminal uses the element to isolate an isotope reward.}
{Reams of data are flowing into this terminal from research outposts all over the planet. As well as a storage depot for the planetary products locked away in the vaults beneath my feet, this is a point of transmission. Knowledge accumulated on this world is being sent up to a scientific flagship hanging in orbit high above my head. I could easily breach the flow to improve my own knowledge, but sharing my own knowledge and discoveries is also an option.}
{Avoid data disruption! Korvax Convergence sends reward for additional data!}
{Breach data flow}
{Share knowledge}
{I gain a new technology blueprint. However, my breach corrupts the overall transfer...}
{The scientists study my offering... ... and thank me with a gift to aid me on my journey.}
{A back-up procedure has come to a standstill. The system is archiving a huge amount of language data, but the system has run out of memory to allocate. I can attach my multi-tool to provide extra space, it would require some variety of metal to re-engage the process...}
{Dialect data process stalled. Metal required to finish process.}
{Insert common metal}
{Insert uncommon metal}
{Insert rare metal}
{The process restarts and provides me with knowledge of the language of the electronic lifeforms.}
{The process continues and improves my knowledge of the language of the electronic lifeforms.}
{The process completes and extends my knowledge of the language of the electronic lifeforms.}
{The facility is processing a signal that emanates from a distant location deep in space. Endless processing units are combining to crack the code of a strange mathematical language. Rare elements are being pulled from the resource vaults at my feet, but some are running low.}
{Atlas Interface signal awakes? Research entity! Insert catalyst constantly! Avoid disruption!}
{Place metal in the vault}
{Place catalyst in the vault}
{Take elements from vault}
{The metals are added to the process. They make no clear impact.}
{The material fuels the code cracking procedure. A faint orb glows red on the screen, then slowly fades.}
{I retrieve rare elements... ... but the code-breaking process grinds to a halt.}
{A trade vault shakes, and closer inspection reveals that it's full of writhing molluscs. They are pink and slug-like, with sharp bloodied teeth. A diagram on the screen in front of me suggests that inserting one in or around my face would have some benefits. What isn't specified, however, is which orifice.}
{Rare balarian speech slug distribution point! For insertion in ear! Inedible! Nasal insertion can cause death.}
{Insert slug in nose}
{Insert slug in ear}
{Insert slug in mouth}
{The slug bites flesh from my nose. The pain is extreme.}
{The slug burrows deep into my ear. I feel better versed in the language of the traders.}
{I swallow the slug, and wait while it thrashes around in my stomach. Nothing else of note occurs.}
{A strange test is visible on the terminal. I see a holographic image of a shell-wearing creature lying on its back in the bright glare of the sun. Try as it might, it cannot right itself. I can manipulate the scene to indicate what I would do to help. A resident Trader has left a note for a colleague.}
{Friend! SynthetiGek identification test active! Remember Gek Trader helps customers!}
{Help creature, then sell it water}
{Study creature}
{Use Bypass Chip}
{I pass the test, proving myself as a true trader. Facility systems are online.}
{I fail the test. Facility systems are non-operational.}
{The strange test is easily bypassed. The facility is operational.}
{A stash of interesting-looking technology and weaponry has been dragged through this facility and left inside a disposal vault. The equipment in the pile appears rusted and broken on-screen, but if I were to eject it all out onto the floor of the outpost I'd be able to better investigate. The disposal vault itself, however, has been daubed with a dangerous-looking symbol.}
{Bootleg pirate equipment discovered in cave! Ready for confiscation and incineration!}
{Incinerate equipment}
{Remove and examine equipment}
{The equipment is destroyed. I am thanked for my actions.}
{The equipment spills out onto the floor.   I salvage a technology blueprint.}
{This is a military terminal, in a facility that seems recently vacated. Three huge databanks have been partially deleted, and will require heightened processing power to restore them. A rare metal would likely do the trick. Databank alpha bares the emblems of the warrior race, but beta and gamma are otherwise unmarked.}
{Vy'keen covert ops ended. Deleting covert ops language data. Databank alpha: Vy'keen internal security. Databank beta: pathetic Gek. Databank gamma: weak-minded Korvax.}
{Restore databank alpha}
{Restore databank beta}
{Restore databank gamma}
{The revived databank provides more information on the language of the warrior species.}
{The revived databank provides information on the language of a distant trader species.}
{The revived databank provides information on the language of a distant electronic species.}
{The facility is online. It begins to manufacture trade goods.}
{The facility is online. It begins to manufacture components.}
{I retrieve a formula from the operational facility.}
{I retrieve a technology blueprint from the outpost.}
{I retrieve an alloy from the facility.}
{I retrieve a helpful product from the installation.}
{I retrieve a strange alien curio from the facility.}
{The facility makes a new multi-tool available.}
{I retrieve a valuable product from the installation.}
{Long ago, it seems, an automated distress call went unanswered. If I can crack the encryption pattern I could potentially extract the coordinates.}
{The operations terminal reveals an automated plea for help. A clear pattern emerges within the white noise hissing from the screen. If I can work out what comes next I could potentially lock down the distressed craft's location.}
{The transmission readout suggests that, long ago, a distress signal went unanswered. A sequence of numbers has been repeating itself for so long that its imprint is burnt into the screen. An input box flashes at me insistently. If I crack the code, I can find the ship.}
{A faint, but insistent, bleeping noise can be heard from the operations terminal. A garbled distress call can be heard amongst it all, alongside screams and the tearing of metal. The only thing that's clear to me is a brief number sequence. Cracking its code could lead me to the crash site.}
{A pulsing red light flashes on the console. Below it, a sequence of numbers repeats itself endlessly. It's clearly a distress signal. It is a cold, empty and distant way of viewing a disaster that, in all likelihood, cost a pilot's life. If I can work out the encryption routine, I could perhaps trace a ship's point of impact.}
{An acoustical beacon can be heard through the operations terminal. It repeats at intervals of 16 seconds. I feel compelled to work out the pattern of its encryption, locate the ship it calls out from... and discover what horror awaits at the crash site.}
{The operations terminal flickers on, and a muffled distress call bleeds from the system. If I can pinpoint its frequency by cracking its encryption I could potentially discover the fate of the poor pilot. The jarring noise of screaming engines and terrified alien chatter I can hear, however, would suggest that it did not end well.}
{This operations terminal has been switched off for many years. I boot it up, and it starts running through a vast database of signals silently recorded by the facilities listening devices. Amidst countless requests for landing permissions and an atonal wall of ship-to-ship chatter, the system suddenly pinpoints an emergency beacon. A distress signal that has never been responded to. If I can isolate the pattern in its encoded frequency, I could perhaps trace the ship that's calling for help.}
{An unanswered distress call seems to be logged on the Transmission Tower operations terminal. No-one has thought to respond. Its encrypted frequency sequence flickers desperately on the screen. Whatever hope the sender once had of rescue has long-since died. If I can work out what's next in the code I can at least find out what happened to them, and where they can be found.}
{As I boot up the operations terminal a hologram of a spacecraft going through a catastrophic planetary descent is beamed into my visor. It's clear that it's on an express elevator to hell. The impact with the planet's surface is made to look tiny. In truth, the impact crater could be vast. The ship's distress beacon can still be heard. It's encrypted, but if I crack the sequence I can lock the frequency...}
{An urgent transmission is logged with the operations terminal. It has been answered, but there's no evidence of a rescue party being sent to answer the distress call. A Transmission Tower worker went to investigate long ago, but no resolution was ever recorded. It's entirely possible that the rescue party itself succumbed to the conditions and roaming predators of this strange planet. If I can isolate the pattern within the encrypted frequencies myself, then I could perhaps finish the job...}
{A red light on the Transmission Tower console throws light on a distress call read-out. Simultaneously the image of a craft violently pirouetting through this planet's upper atmosphere is beamed holographically into my visor. Amazingly, the ship does not break up on re-entry, but instead falls to the ground like a stone. An automated distress beacon can be heard. If I can break its encryption I could find the crash site and, however, unlikely it is - look for survivors.}
{An unanswered distress call seems to be logged.}
{An urgent transmission is yet to be attended to.}
{I'm taking in the view from cameras that feed in the view from the top of the Transmission Tower when I notice an urgent bleeping. An unanswered transmission seems to be logged with the operations terminal. The voice of a ship's pilot calmly intones news of its imminent death to its superiors, or perhaps its family. Its words, however, are lost in static. Only a wavelength cipher remains, if I can crack the code I can perhaps ascertain its true fate...}
{As soon as I access the tower's operations terminal I see hazy images sent from a doomed starship during its plummet to earth. G-force pins the body of its terrified pilot to the top of its cockpit, before slamming its broken body into the control mechanism.  There are clearly no survivors, but I can extrapolate the impact location if I can work out the coding of the repeating ciphers attached to the distress signal.}
{The radio chatter spilling out of the Transmission Tower console is a wall of noise. It's painful to listen to, not least because of the desperate scream of an overheated fusion engine and devastating planetary impact that follows. I try to clear the signal, and search for the encrypted distress signal that I'm sure will lie behind the spacecraft's death throes. I eventually find it, but then must figure out what comes next...}
{In amongst warning lights and urgent communications chatter, I can hear a wavelength cipher repeating itself from the Transmission Tower databanks. It's heavily encoded to prevent pirates tracking its signal and stealing cargo, but with the technology around me and a little intuition I feel as if I could perhaps crack the code sequence. The question is, how should I respond to the beacon?}
{The Transmission Tower's terminal stubbornly refuses to decode a distress signal that seems to have been sitting in the databanks for a long time. If I decipher the code I can hear the message.}
{The tower's communication panel hisses with the conflicting broadcasts of several frequencies. One sounds urgent, but how best to respond?}
{As I access the Transmission Tower terminal I'm met with the unsettling hiss of several overlapping signals. One sounds like a distress signal. If I can isolate the frequency I could pinpoint its location.}
{The tranquillity of the Transmission Tower is suddenly broken by the hiss of an encoded incoming signal. The terminal nearby flashes expectantly, awaiting an access code to unscramble the message.}
{Static from several hissing frequencies mingle offputtingly with a repeating signal that sounds suspiciously like a distress call. If I can pinpoint it I might be able to ascertain its whereabouts.}

{The imprint of an ancient civilization was once absorbed by this strange marker. The story of the Vy'keen somehow spills out, in the language of my own people.}
{The memories of a long deceased tribe of Vy'keen warriors flows from the stone marker, forming into a ghostly essence that fills me with wisdom.}
{Ancient knowledge passed down through generations of Vy'keen warriors spills from the marker stone, filtering into my mind like a long forgotten memory.}
{Runes take shape upon the stone. Burning with light they sing to me of the Vy'keen Ancients in the language of my people.}
{Strange writings form upon the stone, revealing secrets from the time of the Vy'keen Ancients. How I understand them, I do not know.}
{The ancient marker hums at a frequency that burrows deep into my being, filling me with the voices of the Korvax Echoes.}
{Brilliant light erupts from the ancient marker. It encircles me, engulfing my mind with the memories and voices of the Korvax Echoes. The dreams of Entities who once worshipped here become my own.}
{The strange stone marker imparts the wisdom of the Korvax Echoes to those who desire it. I do not know what dialect it speaks, yet somehow I understand the story of those who once worshipped here.}
{Whispers spill from the sharp edges of the artifact, recounting the dreams and memories of the Korvax Echoes in my mother tongue.}
{Lights burst from the obelisk. They pass through me, each a whispered Korvax secret buried for millennia deep within its rock.}
{I convulse as I reach out and touch the beautiful stone marker, my mind filling with a deadly knowledge of the true history of the Gek...}
{As I touch the obelisk, images of the planet's ancient past flood my mind. The terrible beginnings of the Gek have been absorbed by this strange stone, and their tale seems desperate to escape...}
{Memories imbued into the rock long ago by the ancient Gek channel into my brain. I recoil, but am compelled to somehow understand...}
{Flickering emblems appear on the stone. Although I do not recognise the language, somehow I can read of the history of this strange planet and the Gek who once resided here.}
{The surface of the plaque shimmers, and shakes with the screams of a people that lived here long ago. The words are unfamiliar yet in the sounds of Gek anger and outrage, I can hear meaning.}
{It is as though the stone has absorbed the knowledge of those who lived here millennia ago. It speaks to me now in my native tongue.}
{The whispers of the Vy'keen Ancients fill the air. Suddenly words etch themselves upon the marker, and then deep into my mind.}
{My vision clouds and the words of the ancient Gek seem to emerge on the strange stone structure. I sense that these are words that the forgotten and restless want understood...}
{I hear the distant voices of the Korvax Entities who once worshipped here. As they whisper, words written in my own language glow faintly on the monument. The Echoes want to be heard...}
{Knowledge paves the way to the understanding of probability. The Atlas spoke in fragments. The Atlas Interfaces are their shadows. The monoliths are their scattered children. Together they convey the wisdom of the infinite. They must be understood.}
{The Atlas Interfaces drift alone in the endless void. They are silent. They are unknowable fragments of an ancient whole. Yet their imprint on time and space molds our existence.  They are the equation, and life is its answer. Through their Monoliths they give understanding to their boundless meaning, and that of our own.}
{The Korvax Echoes tell of a time, long ago, when the Monoliths of the Atlas woke the civilizations of the Outer Edge. Their presence filled them with a desire for knowledge. From these beginnings empires were born, spoke out and fell silent once more. An eternity that cannot be quantified passed.}
{The Atlas Interfaces await the arrival of the Travellers, those who would seek the ends of the universe through its very core. Within the infinity of time their arrival is probable. Their potential could know no bounds. One dimension in billions will receive them.}
{We are the Korvax Echoes, ever enduring Entities of the Convergence. We live on through the logic and wisdom passed through our metal skins. Each generation is greater than the last.}
{Seek help with language}
{My knowledge of the Korvax Convergence increases.}
{We are the masters of galaxies, the overlords of the cosmos. Each foe will submit with bended knee to the ALMIGHTY Gek Dominion. We are the FIRST SPAWN. Look upon our works and DESPAIR.}
{All who hear our words know of our might. Those who oppose us are broken to our will. Behold the power of the Gek First Spawn. Galaxies lie at our FEET. We are ETERNAL.}
{Through time and space the First Spawn endures, eternally, ever watchful, unyielding over its dominion. Each foe will be CRUSHED. ONLY the Gek will remain.}
{The foul scent of the Gek cannot be opposed. The First Spawn commands all it surveys. We are masters of the stars, our rule shall endure eternally. The Vy'keen and Korvax COWER and DESPAIR at our name.}
{With each conquered world the First Spawn's resolve strengthens. None shall oppose the Gek for fear their planets shall be shaken to dust. We will weep when there are no more worlds to conquer.}
{Seek help with language}
{My knowledge of the Gek increases.}
{The noble Travellers will be spared. Their journey through the cosmos shall not be thwarted. So it is decreed. The will of Hirk commands it. The Vy'keen shall honour the judgment and the belief of the Ancients.}
{The Book of Hirk speaks of the rise of the Travellers. They shall ascend, delving into the boundless void. The Vy'keen shall not impede their ascent for the Travellers must prevail. So decrees the word of Hirk.}
{None hamper the path towards Dryn'dargh as The Sentinels. They must be destroyed. Their time will be ended. So has it been written, so it shall come to be. This the Vy'keen swear.}
{The Sentinels are not of the natural order. Things must fall apart. In their endlessness and replication the automatons prove themselves abominations. They must be purged from existence. All should die, whether through righteous battle or the assault of time.}
{Hirk foresaw the weakness of the Vy'keen warrior kind. The star ascent of our noble race was blocked by the weak-minded Sentinels. Nine times nine fold, Hirk commanded, we would have our vengeance and dash the metal demons against the rocks of damnation.}
{Seek help with language}
{My knowledge of the Vy'keen increases.}
{Eheu. Before the Dark Times the entities of the Korvax worshipped the Sentinels. Through them the Convergence found the formula of enlightenment. Now we calculate our own path, seeking to further enhance the mind of all that is one towards an understanding of the Atlas.}
{The Sentinels forbid all destruction. The Sentinels forbid Entity disconnection through violence. Theirs is a way of peace and fulfillment, of logic and probability. They teach us that each life's value, from the smallest to that which gives life to all others, is equal.}
{For countless generations the entities of the Korvax disconnected and passed on into the Echoes naturally. Each disconnection added to the knowledge and soul of the Convergence. Our home was Korvax Prime. Within its foundations we stored the memories of our race, an ever evolving equation that defines us.}
{Disconnection is not permanent. It is merely the start of a new equation. On Korvax Prime entities who passed on into the Korvax Echoes left their shell for their descendants. So has been the way of the Korvax: an endless carapace cycle that knows no end. This way will continue. It will continue for as long as our lights still shine.}
{Those within the Korvax Echoes have left the physical realm, but they endure through the masks and shells of our children. Thoughts and knowledge ever-growing, we search for deeper understanding of the equation that defines our existence.}
{The Korvax lived peacefully. We praised the Sentinels, learning from them, living beside them in equilibrium. The Korvax honoured the Sentinels' ways, refusing to dig into the sacred ground they protected. We were enlightened.}
{Through research and study we, the Korvax, became powerful within ourselves. The one mind Convergence flourished. Nurtured like a sapling in the light, it grew tall and mighty. The Sentinels brought us the gift of knowledge. We gave thanks to the Atlas.}
{Eheu. Korvax Prime was watched keenly and closely by an unknown race. It lurked in the depths of the darkness. Vigilant and patient it awaited its time. The Great Disconnection was at hand.}
{Eheu. The darkness burst forth with the force of a supernova. The Great Disconnection had begun. A hundred million Korvax voices cried out. The Korvax Echoes became a frenzy of noise. Innumerable cycles passed before balance was restored.}
{The Great Disconnection. The masks and shells of the Korvax survivors shook with the screams of the disconnected. Lights dimmed as the enemy descended, malevolent in its intent. Their numbers were too many. Korvax Prime was destroyed.}
{A hundred million casing lights were dimmed. The Great Disconnection destroyed all that went before. The Korvax Echoes became screams. Years stretched like millennia amidst the disarray yet slowly hope was reborn through logic.}
{Korvax Prime was destroyed. Its secrets spilled into an empty sky. Its fragments touched the edges of the galaxy. Upon this destruction the Gek First Spawn aggressor built its dominion within the Outer Edge.}
{The First Spawn of the Gek disconnected the Korvax. Through obliteration they sought dominion. They stole our planet. Enslaved our survivors. Their revelry made them misguided in thought and deed. Probability dictated that our time would come again.}
{The Korvax were enslaved, driven by cruelty to fulfil the despot's bidding. The First Spawn of the Gek were terrible masters, merciless in their spite, illogical in their cruelty.  Countless entities toiled and disconnected. These tablets are the testament of those who survived.}
{Eheu. The Gek harnessed the technology of the Korvax to conquer worlds. Thieves, usurpers, false lords to the power of infinity. All who opposed their will perished. The balance tipped towards the darkness. These were the times of disconnection and illogical misdeeds.}
{The Gek destroyed worlds. The Sentinels struck back. The technology of the Korvax was used to destroy the machines we venerated. There was endless disconnection. The Convergence shook with great despair.}
{The Entities of the Korvax were forced into chains of silence, but the Korvax Convergence that linked their souls could never be subdued. It endures, forever seeking new formulas to solve the equation of eternal enlightenment. The probability of success is unknown.}
{The Korvax Echoes within the unseen Convergence that linked our souls never relinquished love for the Atlas. As millennia passed this affection spread. The Cult of the Atlas grew within the Gek. The equations and probabilities the Korvax hold dear entered Gek consciousness. They had only to solve it to see the folly of their past miscalculations.}
{The First Spawn could not control the outer edges of their vast Empire. The Cult of the Atlas grew. It taught of harmony through insignificance. Minds that knew only war began to question. Greed and ambition yielded to reason. The Gek floundered. The First Spawn became conflicted and divided.}
{The First Spawn of the Gek overreached. They stretched too far. Their folly and pride knew no bounds. Again and again they tried, again and again they were repelled. The unstoppable force of the Sentinels could not be withstood. The unbendable cannot be broken.}
{The Cult of the Atlas drew forces within the Gek to the Stations of the Atlas. The First Spawn could not prevent it. Arrogant ambition yielded to newfound reason. Stone by stone the Gek Dominion crumbled.}
{The Gek stood in the shadow of the Atlas Interface. It did not open. It did not speak. Yet, the First Spawn felt awe. They felt their insignificance at the centre of an unending universe. It was improbable. Yet within infinity all things remain possible. The Gek changed. The Diminishment had begun.}
{The unspeaking, unmoving Atlas Interface inflicted an insignificance upon the Gek emissaries that showed them their role within the expanse of infinity. It forced recognition of their true place in a limitless universe. The Gek saw their folly, their heads bowed in shame for the miscalculations they had wrought.}
{The Cult of the Atlas took hold as the First Spawn of the Gek crumbled. The Diminishment was at its apex. Endless expansion turned to dust. Eons of aggression receded. The Gek saw new solutions and the Korvax became free. The miscalculations of the past paved the way for the discovery of a newfound balance.}
{The low spawn Gek turned on their leaders. Their First Spawn were cast out, ripped from their spawning pools and cast into the dust. Their lamentations curdled the air. The wisdom of the Korvax and the Atlas prevailed.}
{The Entities of the Korvax are free. Free to study the Atlas. Free to praise the Sentinels. Free to aid the Travellers if probability will allow. Korvax and Gek would begin anew, equal in standing, united in the eternal search for balance and understanding.}
{The coming of the Travellers is possible, as all things are. Yet the chances are infinitesimal. We watch the skies nonetheless. If they do not come here, they will exist elsewhere and our kind – or a kind like us will welcome them. Within the chaos of the infinite we must cling to the probable.}
{All things must happen. All things will occur. Somewhere, elsewhere or as a part of the hereafter. Now ends the testament of the Korvax.}
{The Outer Edge BURNS at the hands of the Gek First Spawn. Our enemies are broken. We are the extinguishers of hope. In our wake we leave only the lamentations of the conquered. We fear NOTHING.}
{The MINOR GEK are the inferior breed, lurking in pools, procreating and dying without consequence. The First Spawn Gek CONQUER WORLDS, each of their spawns is an imprint on the destiny of the galaxy.}
{The larval pools of Balaron GAVE GLORIOUS RISE to the FIRST SPAWN. As we SPRANG FORTH the Outer Edge RECOILED in FEAR. None could oppose our rise. None will bring about our end.}
{The First Spawn is the SCOURGE of the OUTER EDGE. In its wake empires will fall. Planets will crumble. Galaxies will kneel. TREMBLE at our name. For we are the ALMIGHTY Gek. None can oppose our ascendance.}
{The First Spawn GREW. WEAKLING PORWIGLE lost their tails to the Spawning Syrup and became MIGHTY warriors. Each was imbued with the might of the Gek Dominion and its unquenchable will to claim the stars.}
{Those born of the Gek who OPPOSED the Dominion were hurled from the spawning pools of the FIRST SPAWN. Their cherished spawning syrup was replaced with FLAME. Their kind are now merely beasts of the field.}
{The MINOR GEK were purged. It is only through fire that imperfection be destroyed and the path to domination is revealed. The First Spawn feasted on the flesh of the discarded and GREW STRONG.}
{After the OPPOSERS were cast from the spawning pools the Sentinels DESCENDED. Their cause was unjust. Aggressors guided to the fray by the scent emissions of a WAR too GREAT and TOO MIGHTY for the automatons to resist. The First Spawn would remember this.}
{The First Spawn BRED and PLOTTED while the Sentinels patrolled the skies of Balaron for a MULTITUDE of CYCLES. But the automaton victories were but illusions. Beneath watchful metallic eyes Gek legions rose.}
{The HOLY larval pools of Balaron SPRANG FORTH with the PUREST of PORWIGLES. Generation BEGAT generation. Wholesome and strong, iron of fist and with a granite resolve. We, the wise FIRST SPAWN, held back our TIDE of BLOOD. We waited to ATTACK. The unseen blow strikes the hardest.}
{The DAWN of the EMPIRE of the FIRST SPAWN was BIRTHED in the SHADOW of the FOLLY of the Great Vy'keen Sentinel War. The rock and the wave collided as we kept our vigil, awaiting signs of weakness to pave our coming.}
{The Vy'keen FOOLISHLY fought a war with no end. Again and again they threw their warriors against the iron tide. The Sentinels SINGED Vy'keen FLESH with LASER. The Vy'keen scorched their foe with righteous fire. From the SHADOWS the FIRST SPAWN watched and prepared to unleash their reckoning.}
{The Vy'keen and Sentinels clashed, SPILLING BLOOD and WHITE METAL through the void, each blow weakening their defences against the fate that awaited them in the shadows. It would not be long before the First Spawn took their RIGHTFUL place as emperors of the STARS.}
{The Vy'keen SPILLED THEIR OWN PUTRID BLOOD and pushed the SENTINEL MACHINES back from the Outer Edge. They drove forward like crashing tides, leaving broken metal in their wake. For a time the Sentinels became SILENT. In this silence came the GLORIOUS GEK ASCENT. It came with the RIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION of Korvax Prime.}
{Korvax Prime was a VAST and PRECIOUS landscape of MINERAL ORE and POWER. By right of UNIVERSAL RULE the First Spawn claimed dominion over the planet yet the CREDULOUS and FEEBLE Korvax refused to accept their CONQUEST. They DENIED progress. This: their greatest folly.}
{Driven by the misguided desire for planetary equilibrium the Korvax REFUSED to delve deep inside their planet and PROFIT from the JEWEL granted them by FATE. Their love for the DIRE WILL of the Sentinels was ABHORRENT to the Gek. Swift was their end brought about by the First Spawn's STRIKE.}
{The destruction of KORVAX PRIME was VAST, SUDDEN and MIGHTY. In a tide of steel the First Spawn struck, scattering the planet through the cosmos as a warning to the unyielding. The absent Sentinels could not PUNISH the RIGHTFUL ASCENDANCY OF THE GEK.}
{The First Spawn FEASTED on the DEBRIS of KORVAX PRIME, gorging on a banquet of fragments plucked from the void, consumed to fuel the Great Ascendency. The universe shook as the Gek grew RICH. The Korvax found only DESPAIR. The Dominion became whole.}
{A FEAR of the FIRST SPAWN spread throughout the Outer Edge. Planets shook. Systems recoiled. Weak alliances formed and were crushed. ANGUISH CONSUMED WORLDS. They shall fear us FOREVER MORE.}
{The entities of the Korvax were NOT destroyed. The First Spawn are BENEVOLENT. The First Spawn are MERCIFUL. SLAVERY SAVED THE WORTHLESS. They toiled for their conquerors. Their reprieve was found in servitude.}
{The Korvax knowledge BECAME OURS. The Korvax technology BECAME OURS. The Korvax BECAME OURS. They serve as an example of our boundless power and mercy.}
{The Korvax did not dare FIGHT. Respect for the Sentinels is KORVAX WEAKNESS. Weakness is the path to defeat. Today the Korvax fester in ELECTRONIC CHAINS. The Gek look down upon them from their thrones.}
{The Gek First Spawn stand on the MIGHTY BRINK of an ETERNAL EMPIRE. It is ENDLESS in TIME. It is ENDLESS in space. Their dominion will know no bounds. Their armies will know no equal.}
{Every Korvax ELECTRONIC REBELLION will be PUT DOWN. Their appeals to their false and non-existent ATLAS are mere SUPERSTITION found through DESPAIR. They are in VAIN. THEY ARE CONQUERED. The breaking of the uprising shall know NO MERCY. Endless shall be their suffering.}
{This Galaxy is VAST but it is KNOWABLE and it can be CONQUERED. It shall be subjugated. The rising tide of the First Spawn will sweep away any that oppose it. These tablets are our testament FOR ALL TIME.}
{It came to pass that the Great Monolith awoke. It heard the challenge of Hirk. Five times Hirk called upon it and was met by silence. On the sixth cry it awoke.}
{The Great Monolith spoke to Hirk of the Travellers. Their coming should not be met with fire. Their coming was but one dream in an infinite Universe. Their reach would be that of the endless. When Hirk asked of the Sentinels, the Great Monolith said nothing. Hirk was troubled by its silence.}
{Hirk returned to the Vy'keen. 'Grah!' they spake atop the sacred mountain of Dun's'kaareen. And proclaiming loudly to all who had gathered there, their leader said unto them, 'The Great Monolith has answered me. It has awoken.' 'It has told of the coming of the Travellers. They will be spared. The Vy'keen shall honour this decree.'}
{The crowd cried for Hirk to reveal the Great Monolith's judgement of the Sentinel threat. “The Monolith stood silent!” Hirk spake forth, but the people were not satisfied. They muttered amongst themselves and those blessed with tendrils did extend them. Then with raised voice Hirk decreed, “The oppressors will be eradicated! Gather your arms for the time of reckoning is upon the enemy.” And the Vy'keen adored their leader.}
{As Hirk stood upon the sacred mountain Nal climbed to its peak and there with fist outstretched challenged Hirk. 'Fool!' Nal cried. 'The Sentinels cannot be vanquished!' Hirk, with furious rage struck the fool from the mountain. For three moons and suns Nal fell before being claimed by doom.}
{Hirk's rage against the upstart Nal inflamed the hearts of Nal's followers who upon their leader's demise felt the blood of the ancestors rise within them. The Vy'keen nations were bathed in righteous war for sixty-six moons.}
{On the sixty-sixth moon the war cry of the Vy'keen of Nal was silenced. After surveying their bodies, Hirk gazed unto the heavens and there beheld a great Sentinel host descending upon the Vy'keen.The great Vy'keen Sentinel War was at hand.}
{For a multitude of cycles the yoke of the Sentinels had strangled the civilizations of the galaxy in their mewling cribs. Hirk was displeased with the world of the Vy'keen. As the automatons descended, Hirk gazed upon a planet ravaged by weakness.}
{Progress, prosperity and war: these are the things forbidden by automatons. But the Vy'keen were the first to break the shackles, casting the old ways into the pit to herald the birth of a new age. The Vy'keen were the dam that overflowed. Righteous is the flood.}
{Grah! The Sentinels are the enemy of progress and civilization. They are not of the natural order. Their interference is an affront to the virtuous Vy'keen crusade, which seeks to balance in all things through blood, ashes and iron. This affront to the Vy'keen and their creed cannot go unpunished.}
{Before the coming of Hirk the Vy'keen feared the Sentinels. Like all races our people cowered from their unquestioning violence, shrank from their tyrannical rule. But the coming of Hirk heralded a new dawn. Through their leader, the Vy'keen became strong. Now their courage knows no bounds.}
{Hirk looked to the skies and witnessed the pitiless destruction of the Sentinels that smothered all races brought forth out unto the Outer Edge. Worlds withered and died beneath their relentless gaze. The anger of Hirk was unleashed.}
{And so it came to pass that on the eve of the eighteenth moon of Drun'Gala Hirk cast the shackles of the Sentinel oppressors into the pit. The Vy'keen were the glorious first, the rising water that broke the dam. The endless war began.}
{The death of Hirk came during the endless war. Hirk's body was ravaged by old age, becoming ancient and useless. Bellowing, Hirk tore this failing body in two before the Great Monolith, as is the Vy'keen way. The echo of that dying roar can still be heard throughout the Outer Edge. Hirk lives in us, the most venerated of the ancients.}
{Countless cycles sifted through the claws of time. Attrition was great. The battle against the Sentinels raged endlessly. But through righteous fire the Vy'keen endured and the Sentinels burned. The oppressors were pushed back. Back into the dark of space.}
{The Vy'keen saw borders stretch between the stars. Onwards they delved with legions at their back, scorching Sentinel metal from their fiery chariots and attack ships. The Vy'keen gazed upon their conquests and saw that they were righteous and good.}
{The Vy'keen rose in glorious victory, yet noble warriors grew tired and weak. The onslaught against the machines endured for ninety-nine times ninety cycles. There was attrition and incalculable death, but victory eluded them still. The endless replication of the Sentinels slowed, but could not be vanquished.}
{Grah! The Sentinel hordes were pushed back. The oppressors fled into the sanctuary of the cosmos. The spirit of Hirk surveyed the field of battle, and saw that the Vy'keen victory was glorious and just. The automatons became silent as the nation of Hirk feasted upon grahgrah. The songs of the victorious echoed to the edges of the galaxy.}
{And thus the Sentinel horde congregated in the dark places of the void. There they watched in the in-between nothingness. The blackness of space. Thy waited beyond the limits of the Outer Edge. As millennia passed they replenished, growing a force to return their order for countless ages.}
{The Vy'keen licked each other's wounds during the Silence of the Sentinels, while the dishonourable Gek First Spawn chose to destroy Korvax Prime. The Vy'keen condemned this crime, but lacked the strength to fight.}
{The Gek Empire flourished. It spread its empire into the depths of the cosmos. The Vy'keen victory in pushing the Sentinels back from the Outer Edge gave rise to Dominion of another. No world, moon, or race could have opposed the Gek onslaught.}
{The brutality of the Gek First Spawn called back the automatons that were hiding in the darkness. Their forces had grown. Their technologies had developed. The foolish Gek beckoned the monster back into the places where our nations might have dwelt in strange harmony. True Sentinel domination of the Outer Edge began.}
{Within a single lifetime the Sentinels had returned. They came to dwell on every world we knew. Every world we went on to discover. The pathetic, idiotic Gek had doomed the Outer Edge to aeons of their rule.}
{The dominion of the Gek First Spawn crumbled. They fell apart through idiocy, and through the unchanging will of the beings they enslaved but could never understand. Their power is but a memory. Their crimes forgotten by so many.}
{The Gek changed. They became peaceful. Their spawning pools bred in the name of commerce. They Vy'keen accept this peace, but we do not forget as the other beings of the Galaxy are so keen to do. Dishonour is unchanging. Crimes marked in blood do not fade. We do not forget.}
{I'm inspecting the monolith's surface when, suddenly, a ragged claw grabs me. Despite being broken and fragmented, it holds me tight while an ancient metallic beak emerges from the living rock. It shouts in an ancient tongue, unaware of who or what I am.}
{Underling! The Gek First Spawn demand help! Give metal!}
{Give metal}
{Smash claw}
{Wait}
{The metallic hand releases its grip and grabs at my offering. I have perhaps appeased an ancient evil...}
{I smash the metallic claw into pieces.}
{The claw grips me tightly. Just when I feel like my forearm will crack into pieces... ...I am released. The pain is agonizing.}
{I see a strange vision. A small winged creature lands on the very top of the monolith. Suddenly, its eyes glow red and its head revolves in a full circle. It screams for mercy in an ancient voice that wants itself dead. The poor animal has clearly broken its neck, but the monolith's power of possession still animates it. I wonder if the right thing would be to shoot it, and put it out of its misery.}
{Underling! The Gek First Spawn demand you destroy the weak!}
{Shoot the creature}
{Leave the creature alone.}
{The poor winged creature is no more. The monolith rewards my actions.}
{The possession ends, and the poor winged creature drops down dead. All else is silent.}
{A portion of the monolith melts in front of my eyes. The face of a trader emerges, its beak cut off for reasons unknown. It screams and writhes in the bubbling vertical lava, desperately reaching out to me - with a multi-tool in its hand. Supercooled liquid frenium from my suit systems could relieve its pain, but I can also take a risk and pull it from the molten rock.}
{The Gek First Spawn destroy the pirate!}
{Cool lava}
{Reach into lava}
{The relieved ancient trader pushes a gift out towards me. The lifeform is absorbed back into the rock.}
{I pull the overjoyed trader from the burning lava. It dematerialises suddenly, leaving only what it carried.}
{The monolith's glyphs take on a faint yellow tinge, then flicker and disappear. It has no power: the mysterious forces that fuel these stones are weak. I hear a faint crackling whisper on the planetary breeze, and I notice a hole in the monument's base. I could potentially fit some of my mined resources through the gap...}
{First Spawn... power... low ... give... element... organic... carbon...}
{Insert organic element}
{Insert catalytic element}
{Insert metallic element}
{I awake this place's vengeful spirits. They reward me.}
{There is silence. My elements are not returned.}
{There is silence. My elements are not returned.}
{The monolith has the smell of burnt metal and heavy industry. Strange runes swirl and transform, forcing an image deep into my mind. I look into the past. I see a small beaked figure, silhouetted by the light of a forge, industriously hammering armour. Next to it, a cloaked companion idly watches – seemingly content to avoid the work. Both look at me. I must choose.}
{The First Spawn gives help to the worker. The First Spawn destroy the workshy.}
{Choose the worker}
{Choose the onlooker}
{I have pleased this place's spirits. My equipment is filled with a strange power.}
{I have angered this place's spirits. My equipment is damaged by a strange force.}
{The ground in front of the monolith is indented by the knees of a thousand ancient pilgrims who once knelt here. A stone block, slowly, pulls back in front of me. Inside the hollow recess I'm surprised to see canisters of luxury products that have built up there through the ages... I feel greedy unknown forces watching my every move.}
{Goods for the First Spawn! Goods for the ancient terror of the galaxy!}
{Give trade goods}
{Take trade goods}
{Give nothing}
{The undiluted joy of a forgotten tribe spills from the monolith. I am healed, blessed and rewarded.}
{I retrieve several canisters. A feeble howl of pain and dismay whispers around me.}
{A feeble howl of pain and dismay whispers around me.}
{I am not alone. Tiny beaked creatures gambol around my feet. To them I am a giant, and they recoil in terror when they see me towering above them. The air fills with an unpleasant aroma, as they pin themselves against the hard edifice of the unforgiving monolith. The terrifying obelisk itself sits in judgement above us all – both myself and the creatures of the vision.}
{Destroy the impure. Destroy the low.}
{Pet the creatures}
{Further terrify the creatures}
{Before they disappear into the ether, the creatures thank me. The spirits that haunt this place, however, are displeased.}
{The spirits that haunt this place are greatly amused. When the quaking beaked creatures disappear, they are replaced by a gift...}
{A terrible thirst overwhelms me, but my hydration systems are suddenly inoperable. My throat is dry, and I feel dazed. Two ancient stone cups appear. The first is vibrant red chalice full of a slick bubbly transparent liquid. The other is embossed with the shape of a circular red shield, and has a faint yellow tone. Neither look appetizing, but if I don't take in water my death feels certain. My hand wavers between the two.}
{Underling! Drink the healing spittle or drink the recharging spawning syrup of the First Spawn! Choose or die!}
{Drink the transparent liquid}
{Drink the yellow liquid}
{I gag slightly as the liquid treacles through my hydration systems. Suddenly, my body feels renewed.}
{The bitter taste of the liquid washes through my hydration systems. Suddenly, all my systems are stored and repaired.}
{An unseen replication of my own self and exosuit stalks around the edge of the monolith. It screams in an ancient tongue while forcing me down onto my knees. The doppelganger first places its boltcaster to my forehead, and then mimes cutting my belly open with the mining beam. It smiles pleasantly. I am to choose my desired execution.}
{Choose your death! First Spawn favour obedient ToilGek underling!}
{A bolt to the brain}
{A laser beam to the torso}
{Fight back}
{I close my eyes and await death. It does not come. The doppelganger leaves me a multi-tool technology blueprint.}
{I close my eyes and wait to be scythed open. The pain never comes. The doppelganger leaves me an exosuit technology blueprint.}
{My flailing attack is blocked by a shove of my twin's multi-tool. The doppelganger laughs before disappearing.}
{A barely visible crack down the centre of the ancient edifice spits out dust. The monolith shakes, and two vast doors swing open. The interior of the ancient structure is hollow, and has been used as a burial chamber. An ancient beaked lifeform with bulging eyes lies desiccated atop an unlit funeral pyre. At its feet lie ancient treasures and technologies that have been left with it for its next life... wherever that might be .}
{Burn almighty First Spawn obedient ToilGek! Respect First Spawn belongings!}
{Light pyre with Mining Beam}
{Take tomb treasures}
{As it burns the corpse awakes. It nods to me, howling in pleasure. It leaves me its tribute.}
{I snatch away some of the corpse's tribute. The doors slam shut, but an ancient curse hangs heavy around me.}
{The Monolith stands forlorn and seemingly forgotten. If I strain, I can see faint marks in the ground where ancient tribes would once come to worship and commune with the edifice. A gust of alien breeze carries a faint whisper of a voice. I struggle to hear it. Again, the voice echoes around me. Stronger this time. I try to make out the words desperately crying out for my attention.}
{Friend... worship us... kneel before the Gek First Spawn in silence...}
{Kneel}
{Try to communicate}
{Turn away}
{The spirits that have combined with this strange monument bless my journey.}
{There is no answer to my call. I talk only to the wind.}
{The spirits that are melded with strange monument remain silent.}
{A beak emerges from the ancient stone. It's shouting, but can't be heard. In the stone above someone, long ago, has scrawled advice for those who would approach it. The beak screams wordlessly at me, furiously intoning the words of the ancient beings that once worshipped here. My scanner detects traces of a catalyst around it, but can't specify which one.}
{Feed First Spawn beak common catalyst! Metal brings painful noise! Furious noise!}
{Feed beak common catalyst}
{Feed beak uncommon catalyst}
{Feed beak metal}
{The beak whispers the words of those who once worshipped here.}
{The beak shouts the words of those who once worshipped here.}
{The beak screams the words of those who once worshipped here. The noise is extreme. I feel great pain.}
{I see a strange vision. Time is reverted. I am sat on a platform looking down on an execution. Two small beaked traders are kneeling before me. One is small and wiry, the other is obese with jowls that brush the wooden stage. Another lifeform, who wears a green cloth mask, readies an axe behind them. The traders beg me for mercy. The familiar dry, croaky voice of an ancient tribe whispers encouragement into my ear...}
{First Spawn friend receive belongings of the executed. Murder fat trader, or murder rich miner?}
{Execute fat lifeform}
{Execute thin lifeform}
{Show mercy}
{The fat lifeform is finally beheaded after three strikes of the axe. I receive its worldly goods.}
{The thin lifeform is finally beheaded after a single of the axe. I receive all the money it owns.}
{In this timeline at least, the two lifeforms are saved. They weep and thank me. The spirits of the monolith are displeased.}
{A strange new reality grips me. The ancient structure swings open to reveal a body encased in ice. It is a patchwork of different body parts. Its ragged beak appears to have been stitched on with animal gut. A hand-written sign in the language of the ancient traders can be seen above the body's head. Some sort of fuel would most likely melt the ice...}
{Beware! Murderous abomination! Do not awake! Terror! Despair!}
{Melt ice}
{Leave}
{The creature's eyes flick open. Its hands leap around my throat. I force it back into the depths of the disapproving Monolith.}
{The panel on the Monolith swings shut. The abomination remains trapped. I am thanked.}
{I am an observer. I witness beaked traders dressed in modern exosuits leaving an object at the base of a Monolith. It is a small mesh of wires and canisters. They charge it with a strange metal, then quickly depart. As if in a dream, I approach the ancient edifice. It all suddenly feels real. I live and breathe in the recent past.}
{Stop the destruction! Save the Monolith! Protect the First Spawn!}
{Leave object alone}
{Remove chromatic metal}
{The device explodes. Reality is restored. The Monolith was not destroyed, but the spirits that haunt this place are angered.}
{The device is made safe. It was due to explode. Reality is restored. I am thanked.}
{Reality changes. I'm standing in a crater beneath a jet black sky. I'm up to my knees in a strange syrup that glows pink in the darkness. Spherical eggs float around me. Some of these mucus-covered orbs smell terrible, others are sweet and delicate. The taint of the foul eggs is infecting the entirety of the spawning pool. I am filled by an urge to separate them.}
{Retain foul First Spawn stench! Remove sweet eggs from the spawning syrup!}
{Remove noxious eggs from pool}
{Remove sweet-smelling eggs from pool}
{I have angered the ancients Gek spirits that dwell here. Reality is restored.}
{I am smiled upon by vengeful ancient spirits. Reality is restored.}
{I am being watched. I look above, and see a giant lidless eye hovering over the monolith. It stares down at me unblinkingly. It does not move. It does not look elsewhere. Its gaze is remorseless. It feels like it has always been there. Its centre crackles with a bright technological blue...}
{The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair! The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair! The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair!}
{Cower}
{Stare back}
{Shoot eye}
{The satisfied eye fades away. It benevolently leaves a gift.}
{The eye fades away at my challenge.}
{The eye falls to the planet's surface, and is absorbed into the ground. It leaves behind me a precious reward...}
{I hear a low rumble, which gradually builds into an ancient scream. It's like no other noise I've ever experienced. To this strange alien landscape it's a calm silence, inside my helmet it's a nightmarish cacophony of pain and death. Through the noise, however, I can make out some words within the screams.}
{ToilGek dare approach First Spawn holy site? Leave! Leave! Depart or die!}
{Touch Monolith}
{Move away}
{Wait}
{The vengeful spirits that inhabit this place are grateful for my obedience.}
{The vengeful sprits that inhabit this place punish my disobedience.}
{My reality inverts. I am chained on the monolith, my arms are in manacles above my head and my feet are dangling several feet from the ground. A creature, its beak showing through the blackened animal hide mask, approaches on stilts. It wields a red hot metal rod. It pecks at my eyes, then pecks at my tongue. I must choose my punishment.}
{Advancement through pain! Eyes for knowledge. Tongue for language.}
{Choose eyes}
{Choose tongue}
{Beg for mercy}
{The creature plunges its poker into my right eye. This reality fades. I am left with knowledge.}
{The creature plunges its poker into my mouth. The vision fades. I am gifted the knowledge of an alien language.}
{The creature disappears and reality reverts. The metal rod remains...}
{A small green hand reaches out through the stone monolith, its fingernails yellowed and dirty. It opens to show an empty palm, and waits for my response. This feels like part of an ancient tradition. There is no malice, just cold expectation.}
{First Spawn demand tax. Pay units immediately.}
{Give element}
{Give units}
{Refuse}
{The collector refuses my offering. It curses me.}
{The collector takes my offering. The spirits that dwell here are appeased.}
{The collector is offended. I am cursed.}
{I feel faint, as if my mind is being invaded. Pustules on my skin grow, bubble and pop - and I feel countless tiny stabbing pin-pricks scrabbling from each gaping hole. Suddenly metal spiders, perhaps tiny Sentinels, run up my shoulder and into my visor. Can this be real? This CANNOT be real. I start to scream.}
{Calm, child.}
{Wait it out}
{Fire weapon}
{Remove helmet and scrape away tiny metal spiders}
{The hallucination fades. I have passed some sort of test. A reward materialises.}
{The hold on my mind is shattered when I strike the monolith. Reality is restored.}
{The metal spiders enter my skull, and I foolishly rip off my helmet. The hallucination fades. The pain does not.}
{Tiny floating tetrahedrons emerge from the planet's surface and surround me. I try to wave them away with my multi-tool, but each time they swarm closer to it - as if attracted to it somehow. I raise my multi-tool, and they shimmer blue as they dart this way and that. Closer and closer. They are within touching distance of my multitool. They make one final surge...}
{Korvax Echoes will advance the Traveller. Korvax Echoes will advance Traveller's technology.}
{Let the tetrahedrons in}
{Escape the tetrahedron cloud}
{My multi-tool glows bright blue. I have a new technology blueprint.}
{The sharp edges of the floating objects rip holes in my exosuit. I gasp for air while it repairs.}
{I begin to feel dizzy. A strange lethargy comes over me, and I feel compelled to lie down in front of the ancient relic. This place feels calming. It feels like home, wherever that might have once been. I know that if I truly wanted to fight the impulse to sleep I probably could, but I feel warm and comfortable basking in the glow of the ancient runes.}
{Sleep, child. Korvax Echoes bless you.}
{Sleep}
{Resist}
{I sleep deeply. I awake reinvigorated.}
{I resist the command of the monolith. Its power fades.}
{A flickering reflection of my own body emerges from a portal. It mimics every move I make. When I wave, it waves. When I raise my multi-tool, it copies instantly. The doppelganger makes a motion to suggest it wants something, and we both recoil when I realise I've instinctively matched its movements. Its body shimmers, but its equipment looks somehow real. Its multi-tool looks better than my own. The dimensional irregularity is fading.}
{Korvax Echoes command: reward yourself.}
{Give multi-tool}
{Give Propulsion Gel}
{Shoot doppelganger}
{We hand each other our multi-tools before the doppelganger disappears. The mirror-me fades, but the gift can remain.}
{We hand each other propulsion gel before the doppelganger disappears. The mirror-me fades, but both gifts remain.}
{I see my own look of fear in the doppelganger as I pull the trigger. I blast myself in the chest.}
{For many ages it appears that pilgrims have carved numerical figures between the glowing glyphs of the monolith. Looking down, I notice an ancient coin. I scrape the ground with my boot, and unearth several more. The site is otherwise silent. Perhaps it's eternally unresponsive, or perhaps it waits for something.}
{Reject greed. Embrace Atlas.}
{Offer units}
{Take coins}
{The echoes that dwell here awake. They thank and bless me.}
{The echoes that dwell here awake. They are disappointed.}
{I stand next to the powerful glow of the monolith, studying ancient runes, when suddenly my multi-tool begins to heat up. I can see wisps of a strange blue energy being pulled in from the obelisk and surrounding my combat attachments. If I pull the trigger, the exhaust will automatically open - allowing this strange ethereal substance into the body of my equipment.}
{Korvax Echoes bless technology. Allow entrance.}
{Pull the trigger}
{Dismiss the attentions of the monolith}
{The blue energy field fills my multi-tool. It somehow installs a new technology blueprint.}
{The blue energy slowly dissipates. I feel alone once more.}
{I'm running my fingers over the ancient glowing runes, when I look down. An expanding pool of liquid metal has rippled out of the obelisk's base. My feet have already been covered. In the bright reflection I see my expression turn to horror as I begin to sink. I feel warming hands on my legs, pulling me down into the silver sheet. Every hazard detection device on my multi-tool is going haywire. Radiation, heat, cold... every danger imaginable.}
{Bathe in our waters. Feel Korvax Echoes calm.}
{Sink}
{Struggle}
{I emerge from the metal pool in a fetal position. I feel alive and reinvigorated. Some equipment is repaired and recharged.}
{I thrash from side to side in the metal pool. I am free, but the hazards have taken their toll.}
{I see a strange vision. Blue light pours from the monolith as if a curtain has been dropped within. I hear a gentle hubbub of voices, and catch a familiar smell on the breeze. I cannot remember my home, but I know that this doorway leads there. I ache for a past I cannot remember. Every inch of my soul wants to make the leap back. I look to the skies, and the infinity beyond. Can I truly abandon my journey, when it's only just begun?}
{Past is dead. Reconstruction impossible.}
{Step back into the past}
{Resist temptation}
{The portal slips shut as soon as I make a move. I feel the pity of the spirits that live in this place.}
{I try to capture a memory of these sensations, before turning away. The spirits that dwell here admire my decision. I am rewarded.}
{Two stone blocks slowly revolve on the base of the monolith. Two beads of red light then trace images on each one. The red lights then pool together and liquefy in an indentation below. The closer I get, the more agitated the red pool becomes. The images both show masked electronic lifeforms. The first shows the lifeform absorbing power to break free from its shackles. The second shows it hiding from its captors.}
{Korvax Entities escaped slavery. Korvax Echoes share this knowledge.}
{Place hand on the lifeform breaking free}
{Place hand on the lifeform taking shelter}
{The red liquid surges into my multi-tool. It somehow unlocks a technology blueprint.}
{The red liquid surges into my exosuit. It somehow unlocks a technology blueprint.}
{A chiselled hole appears at the foot of the obelisk. From its smoothed edges and the scraped markings around it, it's clear that over centuries unknown creatures have pushed elements through this gap. It's impossible to tell quite what will happen, but below it are three blocks of the exact same dimensions that look like they can be turned by a mechanism deep within the monolith itself. I search my gear for the rare elements that look like they could fit...}
{Korvax Echoes embrace Traveller gift.}
{Insert organic element}
{Insert rare metal}
{Insert rare catalyst}
{The monolith somehow transforms my offering.}
{The monolith somehow increases my offering.}
{The monolith somehow increases my offering.}
{The Monolith disappears. The landscape around me seems the same, but somehow the planetary vegetation has moved. Sitting central to where the mysterious stone once stood is a red glowing orb. The intensity of the orb burns the ground beneath it. It crackles with an unknown power. I feel compelled to pick it up, and become a part of it. A distant voice speaks to me...}
{Behold the holy Atlas stone. Avoid contact. Show respect.}
{Hold red orb}
{Stand back}
{The red orb scorches my skin. I am torn back to my own reality.}
{The red orb convulses, hovers up and plunges into my chest. I am blessed and rejuvenated. Reality is restored.}
{I'm trying to read the ancient glyphs when a liquid metal lasso emerges and wraps itself around my helmet. It freezes in place, before pulling my head into contact with the glow of the monolith. The ancient stone is warm, and deep inside I hear the hum of an arcane technology as it prepares to unleash itself. I look up back up to the glyphs to try to guess why this might be happening. They talk to me in an alien tongue.}
{Korvax Echoes bless with language. Do not resist.}
{Pull free}
{Wait}
{An entire language floods every part of my mind. I retain what I can. The rest fades almost instantaneously.}
{I wrench myself free. The strange metal connector sparks and hisses. I retain the rare elements it was made from...}
{A child emerges from the monolith. It takes a few moments before I realise that... it's me. I look carefree and innocent. The little one stares up at my exosuit, and tries to see me through my visor. The child suddenly starts to weep, and clings to my knees. It implores me never to leave. It doesn't want to be alone. I should stay here forever. We should be reunited. Whole again once more.}
{Past is dead. Youth is over. Only the traveller journey remains.}
{Stay}
{Comfort, then leave}
{Leave}
{The child withdraws and shakes its head. I try to embrace it. It turns to dust.}
{The child understands. We embrace. It leaves me with a gift.}
{The child wails. It can't understand my decision. The monolith looks down upon us in silent judgement.}
{An empty shell of an electronic lifeform emerges from the monolith. It is ancient and weather-beaten. The light in its mask has been extinguished for many centuries. It holds a rusted canister in its hand, and my scanner detects that it once held refined metal. The scan also reveals an unknown substance deep within the defunct entity's casing.}
{Korvax Echoes request! Traveller! Restore holy casing to Korvax Convergence! Ignore valuable casing! Please!}
{Add metal to canister}
{Open casing}
{The lights in the mask flicker on. The casing convulses before being absorbed back into the monolith. I am blessed.}
{I crack open the metal casing and retrieve a valuable reward. A strange feeling of coldness and desolation comes over me as I do so...}
{The land around me suddenly inverts. My reality is flipped. The inside of the planet is hollow, and I'm standing at the base of its vast bowl. Around me the roots of trees push upwards from uncovered alien soil. I look down, and see the foundations of the Monolith raised at my feet. Crystalline veins of different elements pulsate through the exposed rock. I hear a lifeform screaming in binary.}
{Overpowered Korvax Echoes subvert reality. Restore order. Remove power. Remove organic corruption.}
{Extract organic elements}
{Extract metal}
{Extract rare metal}
{Reality is restored. Inversion ends. I am thanked.}
{The inversion gets worse. I feel as if every part of me is fed through itself. I emerge alive, but broken.}
{My movements seem normal, but everything else is running faster than it should. The sun spins around this globe in seconds, days endlessly turn to night and back again. The creatures that graze and hunt around site pass by in a blur. I'm trapped in a time vortex. Numbers on my multi-tool seem to tick higher and higher. The closer I get to the Monolith, the more disturbance is added to the timeline...}
{Traveller! Move back to join future. Touch monolith to restore timeline.}
{Touch monolith}
{Move away}
{The timeline is reverted and restored. Nothing has changed.}
{I step out into the future. My experience is unchanged, but galactic interest rates have had an effect on my unit count.}
{I am being watched. A red laser dot appears on the ancient stone structure. I'm a target. I turn, but can't see the potential assailant. Somewhere out there on the alien landscape, someone's about to pull a trigger. There's no cover to speak of, and no time to get behind the obelisk. Suddenly, the words of an unknown power blaze brightly on the monolith.}
{Traveller, retreat! Korvax Echoes give protection. Move back.}
{Touch monolith}
{Move back}
{Stand still}
{The monolith does nothing. A distant crack of a long-range boltcaster wounds me. Beyond that, silence.}
{I quickly move back, allowing a bright red energy surge to build in the Monolith. It targets a distant figure, who is swiftly vaporised.}
{Stars have aligned above the monolith. In the heavens above two distinct lines of distant suns can be seen stretching out into the depths of space. To be here at this exact moment in time, when the moving parts of the galaxy are aligned so perfectly, would seem almost an impossibility. I am filled with a strange calm. One line of stars points towards the glow of a dull red giant, the other an unseen point far, far beyond my vision.}
{Traveller. Embrace unknown. Shine light in darkness. Discover galaxy centre.}
{Choose red giant}
{Choose unseen point}
{The stars seem to move out of alignment. I am unrewarded, and alone.}
{I am blessed with a gift that will aid my journey to this distant, unknown location.}
{I feel faint. Ill, even. Looking around, the vegetation that surrounds this ancient structure looks withered and sickly. The creatures of the planet, meanwhile, appear to keep their distance. Environmental warning sensors in my exosuit are behaving erratically. I could tie some of my Protection Mesh's operations to this place, but it's unclear exactly what. The answer perhaps lies in a warning that's been etched into the stone...}
{Beware! Monolith create dangerous toxins! Poison! Move back!}
{Reduce monolith's toxicity}
{Dampen monolith's radiation}
{The toxins released by the monolith are temporarily contained. I am thanked by the planetary overseer.}
{The monolith continues to poison the land around it, and myself.}
{I am trying to read the glyphs on the ancient monument when I feel a strange chill. A layer of frozen gas suddenly coats the monolith from bottom to top. It's so cold that I can see my breath inside my helmet. There is one small gap in the crystal ice, and I feel convinced that I could feed some of my mined elements through it, so they can come into contact with the monolith behind.}
{Fuel given. Ice thaws. Vy'keen rise.}
{Insert organic element}
{Insert catalytic element}
{Insert metallic element}
{The frozen gas melts into the atmosphere. I am rewarded.}
{There is silence. My elements are not returned.}
{There is silence. My elements are not returned.}
{The body of a warrior emerges from the obelisk, a jagged tear in their midriff suggesting that the dangerous-looking multi-tool that sits in their hand was not enough to save them. The surface of the sculpted rock blurs and shows images of military worship. It's trying to tell me something.}
{Respect the Warrior! Respect their weapon!}
{Bury the soldier and multi-tool}
{Take the multi-tool and leave}
{Ancient voices howl their appreciation in a wind that whips around me. An offering emerges from the monolith.}
{I take the multi-tool from the body. I'm about to turn to leave when a crimson bolt of energy strikes me on the right shoulder.}
{I see a strange vision. A small terrified creature emerges from the monolith and runs between my legs. I hear the noises of an ancient hunt: the howls of pack animals in pursuit and the thunder of hooves.  Warriors on vast beasts charge through the rock, and amidst the chaos one sees me staring. It raises its facial tendrils in greeting, barks a few words and swings a bladed weapon down towards me.}
{Grah! Vy'keen Ancients bless your journey!}
{Grab weapon}
{Dodge weapon}
{The hallucination fades, but the blade remains. It transforms into a multi-tool I can use.}
{I dodge the warrior's attack. The hunt disappears, and I am left alone.}
{The monolith shows images of creatures lying dead before it. Each sacrificed, butchered and offered up to whatever Gods were once worshipped here. Suddenly, the head of a small woodland animal raises up through the earth below me. It stares at me with wide-eyes, then gives a joyful skip when its tiny hooves reach ground level. Something is clearly expected of me...}
{The command of the Vy'keen Ancients! Sacrifice the beast! Blood for Hirk!}
{Sacrifice the creature}
{Let the creature live}
{I blast the woodland animal in two. I am rewarded for this offering.}
{The creature skips around my feet with joyful abandon. It runs away and out of sight.}
{Two ancient stone cups materialise in front of the monolith. One is filled with a dark red viscous liquid, the other contains a sticky fluid that is bright yellow and smells powerfully bitter. On the stone tablet behind the cups ancient glyphs swirl to form an image. A powerful and muscular warrior surrounded by a red halo challenges an opponent clad in bright yellow armour.}
{Choose healing blood or renergising bile of the Vy'keen Ancients. Drink destiny.}
{Drink the viscous red liquid}
{Drink the bitter yellow liquid}
{The liquid seems to clot as I swallow it. I feel somehow reinvigorated.}
{The liquid tastes foul as it washes down my throat. Suddenly an unknown power repairs all my equipment.}
{The monolith rips like paper, opening a window to another world. It is laced with a giant web. Just within my reach, an ancient warrior lies cocooned. It has been there for centuries. Dead, vacant eyes stare through me and on into the landscape beyond. It carries a rusted multi-tool, while a bulging webbed sack on its chest suggests it might carry greater riches on its body. Suddenly, the strange leathery growth starts to move...}
{Pathetic dead coward lies here! Interloper! Take your remuneration...}
{Take multi-tool}
{Search body}
{The multi-tool is not operational. I salvage a new technology blueprint.}
{Hundreds of arachnids burst from the warrior's corpse. Their bites are poison, but my search is rewarded.}
{A portal opens on the monolith, and the body of a huge winged animal falls to my feet. Its throat has been ritually cut, and its wings have been tattooed with faces of an ancient warrior tribe. The eyes though, the eyes look strange... Its original eyes have been cut out, and replaced by glittering red orbs. The more I look, the more they blaze. An advanced technology clearly lies at their centre. Can I bear to desecrate this sacrifice for help with my journey?}
{Respect the Vy'keen Ancients sacrifice. The beast has holy sight.}
{Remove sacrifice's eyes}
{Respect sacrifice}
{The red orbs glow, then crackle information through my multi-tool. I gain a blueprint, but have angered an unknown power.}
{The ancients that dwell here smile on my decision. I am blessed.}
{The giant mouth of an ancient hound suddenly emerges through the face of the monolith. It opens its jaws wide, and foul-smelling spittle streaks my visor. My nausea is tempered by the sight of valuable commodities balanced on its giant tongue. In a sudden movement the hound shifts the goods to one side of its mouth, spraying saliva over my arms. There's space on the tongue for more, should I wish to give up some of my cargo...}
{Feed the beast}
{Place goods on giant hound tongue}
{Remove goods from giant hound tongue}
{The hound swallows my offerings, and licks me enthusiastically. I am blessed by an ancient power.}
{The giant beast clamps its jaws, puncturing my arm with a yellowed canine. I retrieve the offering.}
{An ancient warrior's feet and legs slowly emerge from the bottom of the monolith. The rest of its torso then follows, unceremoniously pushed out onto the alien turf. It has been decapitated. Blood drips at my feet and high above me a disembodied head laughs at my shock. It shouts a guttural command of encouragement down to me. Behind, I hear an ancient blade unsheathe, and someone rushing towards me...}
{Brave interloper! Resist fear!}
{Stand}
{Kneel}
{A spectral blade passes through my neck. I pass the test. The blood that drips from the warrior's exposed neck turns into a reward.}
{A spectral blade passes over my head. The disembodied skull seems disappointed. I have perhaps failed some sort of test.}
{The monolith fragments before my eyes. It folds down in on itself, again and again, until it is a tiny red orb surrounded by dancing lights. It feels like something truly ancient, perhaps something divine, is showing me the origin of these strange constructions. The metal I carry is physically dragging me towards it - desperate to help it rebuild. It's not so much that I'm a pilgrim bearing offerings in hope of a blessing, but more that the elements I carry want to offer themselves...}
{The Vy'keen feed the Atlas stone rare metal. It builds. It towers.}
{Give common metal}
{Give uncommon metal}
{Give rare metal}
{I see my insignificance within the infinite bounds of space. The monolith slowly rebuilds inch by inch. I am pitied.}
{I see my true place within the infinite depth of space and time. The monolith slowly rebuilds. It pities me.}
{I see my true place within the infinite depth of space and time. The monolith rebuilds, and rewards me in consolation.}
{I place my palm on the monolith, then stand back when it melts in response to my touch. Molten rock drips down the stone, exposing a hollow interior. Inside, I see riches that are beyond belief. Ancient technologies and cargo that would aid my journey. Lava continues to drop, and the edifice seems unstable, but equipment that could aid me is within arm's reach. Suddenly, the voice of an ancient tribe shakes the ground I stand on...}
{The Vy'keen Ancients burn thieves and pirates.}
{Reach in}
{Stand back}
{The molten monolith collapses onto my exosuit. The edifice is reconstructed – the damage remains.}
{The ancient warriors who once worshipped here bless my show of respect.}
{There are three vast columns of words on the ancient structure, each written in a different alphabet. The first column's words are like savage runes scratched in sand, the second shows precise sequences of dots. The final column has wide and welcoming letters, almost appearing hand-written in hard stone. The dirt and blood of ancient hand prints cover the base of each column.}
{Grah! Learn language of the conquerors! Learn language of the conquered!}
{Press hand against runes}

{The ancient spirits that dwell here infuse me with the language of their warrior descendants.}
{The ancient spirits that dwell here infuse me with the language of a distant race of electronic lifeforms.}
{The ancient spirits that dwell here infuse me with the language of a distant race of beaked traders.}
{I become a part of a strange new reality. The ancient rock opens. Inside, the dried out heart of an ancient warrior is strung up between wooden pillars. It pulses slowly as it hangs there, still beating. Lying below it on a dusty floor are a set of wrinkled lungs that look forever doomed to wheeze stale air. A desiccated eyeball stares up at me. Unblinking.}
{Rebuild the ancient warrior body. Restore monolith power.}
{Shoot heart}
{Place lungs with heart}
{Respectfully depart}
{I hear an ancient scream. The monolith's power fades.}
{The heart and lungs pulse in harmony. The monolith's power is restored.}
{The monolith closes. I hear disappointed wails from inside.}
{I live within a new reality. I am inside a vast coliseum and beneath a blood red sky. The noise is overpowering. Warriors scream and bark at the battle set up before them. Two combatants are squaring up on the crimson sand. One has lost its blade, and hides behind a shield. The other stalks towards it, with a spear raised. I feel compelled to add my voice to the howl of the mob.}
{Choose your warrior! Vy'keen ancients reward interloper howl!}
{Support endangered gladiator}
{Support spear-wielding gladiator}
{The gladiator decapitates its foe with the sharpened shield. It bows towards me. I am thanked with something to defend me.}
{The gladiator plunges the spear straight through its rival's head. It bows towards me. I am thanked with something to help me destroy my enemies.}
{I place my hand on the ancient structure and feel an intense heat burning within. Suddenly, as if attracted to my suit, a liquid metal starts to seep from a hole that's been broken into the rock. What starts as a drip, becomes a surge forcing itself through the gap. The monolith's previous contents are draining, and its glow is starting to fade. A voice screams out.}
{Seal gap! Protect Monolith! Precious valuable material lost! Use metal!}
{Plug hole with metal}
{Plug hole with catalyst}
{Take molten substance}
{The hole is sealed. The monolith's contents are secured. I am safe, and thanked.}
{The catalyst reacts with the molten material. It vaporises, both within the structure and without. The monolith's power fades.}
{The molten material burns my suit. Its value makes the pain worthwhile.}
{The body of a gilled blob creature materialises on the surface of the rock. It is an ancient sacrifice, impaled through its wide, open eyes with metal spears. Liquid is dripping from the body down the monolith through a channel cut into the rock by ancient hands. It can be diverted toward two carvings – one of a sun, the other of a moon.}
{Light brings power. Darkness brings resilience.}
{Divert body liquid to sun}
{Divert body liquid to moon}
{Take metal spears}
{The Monolith creates my chosen reward. I am blessed.}
{I take the metal spears. The blob fades away. I have disappointed an unknown power.}
{I feel drained. Readings on my multi-tool and exosuit start to gradually pull downwards, and a feeling of lethargy overwhelms me. I breathe normally, but my body screams for oxygen. The monolith, silent and unmoving, towers above. A thought from outside my own mind starts to echo through my consciousness.}
{Ancients consume interloper life force! Ancients reward interloper for rebirth! Closer! Faster! Closer! Faster!}
{Touch monolith}
{Stand still}
{Move away}
{The monolith swiftly drains life force through my outstretched arm. It is rejuvenated, and I am rewarded.}
{The monolith slowly drains me of my life force. After an extended period of lethargy and pain, I am rewarded.}
{I move beyond the reach of the life-draining monolith. It towers above me. Implacable and disapproving.}
{It's the time of day that this mysterious site becomes active. A beam of light shines down from the sky and is focused by ancient glyphs onto a stone surface marked with ancient carvings. The beam of light slowly traces towards images scratched into the stone. A vast warrior battle, an alien city and what could be a stolen treasure. The hand prints of pilgrims cover each one...}
{Hirk took the treasure of Nal after battle. Treasure now hides in the city of Hirk.}
{Touch battle image}
{Touch city image}
{Touch treasure image}
{The beam of light disappears. I am left alone in this desolate place.}
{The image of the city begins to glow. A part of an ancient treasure becomes mine.}
{A sudden pulse of destructive energy flows through my exosuit. My multi-tools sensors sense another build-up of energy growing deep within the monolith. It will soon unleash itself on me, and the landscape that surrounds the ancient site. I can use my Protection Mesh functions to dampen the imminent energy wave, but systems are too overwhelmed to identify it...}
{Warning! Keep clear! Ancient radiation pulse site!}
{Prepare to absorb radiation}
{Prepare to absorb toxins}
{The radiation wave is absorbed and the site made safe once again. The planetary overseer is grateful.}
{I am overwhelmed by the energy wave. Systems cannot cope and planetary ecosystems are disrupted.}
{I am suddenly underwater. I am drowning. Water clogs my lungs. My chest is on fire. I gasp for air where there is none, and feel only tepid liquids filling me inside and out. My vision is clouding. I know this is my time. This is it. This is what it feels like. Suddenly, a green hand thrusts itself through the surface of the water. The light is fading.}
{Warrior accepts journey's end. Embrace death.}
{Reach for hand}
{Die}
{I reach for the hand, but it pushes me back down. Reality reverts. I live, but have disappointed.}
{The lights go out. Reality reverts. I have known death, and it makes me stronger. The ancients bless me.}
{The ancient spirits that reside here reward me.}
{My journey has been blessed by an ancient force.}
{The Portal opens...}
{The Portal remains closed}
{The ancient power of the Korvax Echoes can be seen in the vast Portal that stands before you. You hear them calling out to you. They speak in a familiar tongue.}
{Have the travelers come? Are they here?}
{Tell us. Tell us what the fascinating sentinels hold.}
{It is probable}
{Absolutely}
{No}
{An unknown power}
{Lasers}
{A bad attitude}
{The vast Portal stands before you. You hear the small, desperate voices of the Gek First Spawn. They speak in your own language.}
{What has become of the Gek? Do they still adore the First Spawn?}
{The First Spawn is mighty! How vast has the Dominion of the First Spawn become?}
{The Gek respect their mighty ancestors. They speak of you often}
{The Gek are busy creatures. It's hard to tell}
{They are obsessed with commerce. They forget you}
{Your Empire is vast. It spans galaxies}
{I don't know. I can't tell you}
{Your spawn are now Traders. They reject you}
{You hear the noise and tumult of a distant world. Suddenly, the screams of the Vy'keen Ancients tear at your mind. They howl in a language you can somehow understand.}
{The Atlas Interface! It told us about you! Tell us... what was its message?}
{Grah! Do you fight the Sentinels? War without end!}
{The Travellers will be spared}
{The Travellers will be eradicated}
{The Travellers will be let through any Portals they happen to find}
{I fight the Sentinels. They do not relent, but I fight them}
{I fight when I must. I do not fear them}
{I learn from the Sentinels. They hold secrets}
{Echoes from a distant world call from behind the gateway. A new land lies beyond.}
{The portal looms above me, keeping a silent vigil over the planet. Few are shown the path to the distant world it guards.}
{The world that lies beyond the portal seeps into my mind. It beckons and calls out to me. The pathway to the unknown wants to be opened.}
{The towering edifice is a portal. A gateway to another world somewhere in the skies above. I hear the whispers of an unknown land.}
{Echoes of a distant planet emanate from the ancient stone structure. The mysteries of an unknown world lie within.}
{The giant gateway calls out to me, filling my mind with whispered secrets of a far-flung world.}
{The lifeforce of another planet pulses from the portal. Invisible yet tangible, I hear it calling out. A few steps could complete a journey that, long ago, would have consumed lifetimes.}
{A land of strange creatures, plants, sounds and sights lies beyond the portal. They are distant and unknown. I can hear the gate's call repeating in my mind.}
{The strange structure is a gateway to another planet. A locked passage through the cosmos to an alien world. I feel pulled towards it, and the distant location it somehow connects to.}
{The vibrations of a distant world pulse from within the portal. Its call is intoxicating. The gateway begs to be opened.}
{The giant edifice wakes. It reveals the pathway to a distant world.}
{The portal opens. A distant land awaits...}
{The portal opens. A journey has been prepared for me.}
{The gateway opens. The time has come to discover its secrets.}
{The noise of a distant land spills from the portal as the gateway opens. Another world awaits.}
{The portal opens. The pathway to another planet is ready.}
{Sensations of vast heights, distances and all the places in-between engulf me. The portal is open.}
{The air of an distant world gusts towards me. The gateway is waiting.}
{The portal's great doorway opens. A distant planet waits for my call...}
{Light from another star spills from the portal. The gateway is open.}
{The portal remains dormant. A lonely silence hangs heavy in the air.}
{The towering gateway stays closed. The portal keeps its secret.}
{No pathway is revealed. I remain here, alone, in the alien silence.}
{The portal stays silent. I am left alone with the winds of an alien world.}
{A new world is forbidden. The portal stands dormant.}
{The colossal portal keeps its silent vigil. What lies beyond remains a mystery.}
{The gateway remains closed. The portal continues its vigil, unmoved.}
{The portal remains closed. There is only silence.}
{The portal will provide no passage. The gateway remains closed.}
{The portal continues its silent vigil. The planet beyond remains a mystery.}
{Open portal}
{Priest Entity Nada}
{As I approach the electronic being, it springs to life. From its dark mask, scanning beams emerge that envelop me. There is a unnerving chittering sound and then, unbelievably, it speaks in my language. It offers me a choice. It can show me how to harness black holes, in order to embark upon a journey to the centre of the galaxy. It can light my way to an Atlas Interface, so I may follow a path. Or it will assist me in my own exploration.}
{Nada, is, they reveal, a Korvax priest somehow freed of the group mind, now researching the origins of the galaxy. They express a bold theory - that our entire reality is something else's experiment. A simulation. I want to laugh, then I remember the Atlas. Nada offers me a choice again - or is it a test? Be returned to the fixed path of the Atlas. Find black holes to carry me to the galaxy's core. Or accept a gift to aid me in my own travels.}
{Nada's normally-restrained form is jittering and dancing, the external symptom of an internal struggle. Iridescent lights fluoresce across their visor. At times, another entity seems to stare out. I grasp their arm firmly, and soon a familiar light-pattern reasserts itself. The Korvax endlessly attempt to regain their errant shell and wipe Nada from existence. But the Priest Entity won't succumb until they have solved the riddle of reality.}
{Nada is plugged into a bank of instruments as I approach. Suns flare and die on the panels, voxel-molecules pop in and out of existence in matched pairs. I see error messages reeling on the readouts and am perplexed. Nada sees me and explains. There are repeating patterns all across the galaxy, identical elements where there should be endless divergence. This cannot be a coincidence. Did the Atlas do this? Across the room, Polo giggles.}
{Nada stays back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us. Nada explains that their reasoning has advanced. They have found no room in the galaxy for free will or anything but brutal causation. They worry we are but pawns of whatever higher being created us - puppets, dancing on strings. And Nada suspects me. I am the aberration. Am I the puppet-master too?}
{Nada's paranoia is infectious. I find myself spying into the room before I enter. The Gek, Polo, seems occupied, taking joy in their chores, but Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights. Was... was that a flash of red behind the visor? If it was, it doesn't repeat. I wait a moment and enter loudly. Polo greets me effusively, but Nada and I are standoffish, our trust failing.}
{Nada and Polo are unusually quiet. Polo is elbow-deep in machinery, Nada in simulations, but the room is tense. It is clear that there has been a recent disagreement. Nada beckons me over. They express frustration over being tied to a machine body. But I am different - able to survive in so many ways, in so many places. I can go anywhere in this galaxy, be it in search of truth or to live my life as I see fit. Nada envies me, they admit.}
{Nada stands close this time. If the being was capable of emotion, I'd say they were racked by it. They hesitantly rest a hand on my shoulder, and the visor moves close. I cannot see beneath the mask, but I feel that Nada is staring into my eyes. If I continue to the centre, this will be goodbye. Neither of us know if either will survive. If anything will survive. If freedom or destruction awaits us. Fearfully, sadly, Nada bades me farewell.}
{The panels and systems are idling now. Nada seems to have learned all it can from them. I report my travels and discoveries, and their mask lights up.  All the pieces have fallen into place, Nada explains. Where once Nada stared at starmaps, now they see lines of code. Connections and patterns everywhere. The galaxy is a spiderweb - but who or what is the spider? The centre is close now. Perhaps soon we will know. I shiver involuntarily.}
{Rare linguistic form. Pleasure! Nada, divergent Korvax. Assistance offered. Route to galactic core? Reconnect with Atlas for guidance? Resources for journey? Yes/no?}
{Repeated visitor! Welcome. Assistance again? Return you to Atlas' control? Find galactic core, meaning? Help you on journey? Decide.}
