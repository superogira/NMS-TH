PATCH1_NOTES	{Update 1.03 
Hello Games has been hard at work to improve No Man's Sky. 

We've had to regenerate the universe.

NOTE! Your in-game location may be adjusted as a result. Your overall progress will be unaffected.

* Terrain is more weird and varied. Destruction is more powerful.
* LOD generation entirely asynchronous.
* Scanning from space now possible.
* Extreme hazardous planets may now be generated. Please exercise caution upon planetfall. 
* Low atmosphere planets may now be generated.
* Tuned frequency and intensity of space conflict. Ship bounties added. Expect trouble.
* Streamlined inventory management.
* Guidance and freedom are now optional.
* More secrets.

Going to sleep now.}

TRA_NPC_DESC_1	{The small creature is busy adding up trade profits when I appear. Their eyes open wide in anticipation of our first contact, and they rub their fingers together greedily.

The lifeform pecks emphatically at the monetary figures on their pad, then bounces up and down. I can't help but notice that they smell amazing.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_1	{Hello new friend! The Gek first encounter tradition is to give units!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_1	{Give units}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_1	{Apologise for being unable to help}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_1	{Pat the lifeform on the head}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_1	{The lifeform is clearly thrilled. They give me something in exchange.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_1	{The lifeform looks disappointed. They take pity on my confusion, and give me some units.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_1	{There is a long silence. The trader emits a foul-smelling gas.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_2	{The trader eyes the facility exit door sadly, as if they have been stuck in here for a while. They reach down with their beak and dejectedly pecks at their suit's power cells and life support system.

Their suit looks run down. The lack of charge means that it's ill-equipped for the hostile conditions that rage outside.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_2	{Despair! Gek Trader stranded. Suit power low. Give carbon?}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_2	{Give Organic element}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_2	{Give Catalytic element}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_2	{The relieved trader emits a gas packet. They recharge their suit power cells, and reward me.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_2	{The lifeform is confused.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_3	{The trader has been expecting me. They point to their chest, opens their arms wide, and beam pleasantly. They then point to me, and mime concern for my safety.

Pecking at my exosuit, they indicate they might make my journey more bearable.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_3	{The Gek Trade Federation offer help!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_3	{Request help with the Sentinels}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_3	{Request help with planetary conditions}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_3	{The trader offers me a new multi-tool.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_3	{The trader gives me an exosuit technology blueprint.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_4	{The lifeform sits in a foul-smelling funk of their own creation. The trading screen behind them is empty, their equipment old and uncared for. Their suit barely looks airtight.

The demoralised lifeform looks up at me with hope in their eyes.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_4	{Despair! I am trapped and bankrupt! Low units!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_4	{Give units}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_4	{Give product}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_4	{Refuse to help}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_4	{The grateful lifeform gives me the last of their belongings.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_4	{The lifeform's eyes widen. They thank me.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_4	{The lifeform sits in total dejection.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_5	{The lifeform clucks and gabbles as they study my equipment. They gently peck at areas of my exosuit that show wear and tear, then runs their gloved fingers over my multi-tool to look for irregularities and imperfections.

Suddenly staring up at me, they squawk an offer and spin a tablet that shows the cost of their services.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_5	{Friend! I am a Gek Trade Federation accredited engineer! I give help!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_5	{Pay for multi-tool inspection}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_5	{Pay for exosuit inspection}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_5	{The lifeform repairs and recharges all my equipment.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_5	{The lifeform mutters and clucks.

They give me a new exosuit technology blueprint.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_6	{The trader seems ill. Their skin is flaking their eyes lack a certain lustre. Their voice croaks and scratches as they slowly gabble at me.

A strange dry, flat stench fills every corner of the facility. I inspect my exosuit for things I could offer this lifeform...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_6	{Friend... Installation hydration system stalled... Gek temperature high... Help friend... thirst... high... drink... fluid...}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_6	{Give food from exosuit's nutrient system}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_6	{Give water from exosuit's hydration system}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_6	{The disappointed trader waves me away.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_6	{The trader greedily gulps from my hydration system.

Their gratitude seems immense.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_7	{The trader looks weak, but they have a cunning air about them. They spin a datapad towards me, and I see that they're selling Multi-Tool components. The prices, however, are eye-watering.

They eye me with a wary interest, waiting to see if I'll bite...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_7	{Friend! The planetary technology SalesGek greets you! A multi-tool technology blueprint for a fair price!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_7	{Pay requested amount}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_7	{Pressure lifeform into accepting less}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_7	{The delighted trader provides a blueprint. They emit an amazing scent.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_7	{The angry trader grudgingly relents. They emit a foul scent.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_8	{The lifeform is poring over complex schematics while holding their breath. The holographic blueprints look corrupted. Damaged in-flight, perhaps.

The forlorn trader, their face smudged by a strange oil, looks up to me for help.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_8	{Despair! Friend, my Deflector Shield blueprint is corrupt!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_8	{Show Pulse Engine blueprint}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_8	{Show Phase Beam blueprint}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_8	{Show Deflector Shield blueprint}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_8	{The lifeform thanks me politely... But looks at me as if I am deranged.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_8	{The trader makes an audible sigh.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_8	{The overjoyed trader gabbles its thanks. They excitedly hand over a gift.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_9	{The trader welcomes me with a pleasant-smelling gas emission. They open a holographic catalogue of exciting companion units for Mining Beams and Boltcasters.

I spot a catalogue of advanced weaponry behind the trader while they're trying to impress me with what looks like a curtsy.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_9	{Friend! The planetary SalesGek greets you! Low units technology!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_9	{Offer units for an exosuit technology blueprint}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_9	{Offer units for a new multi-tool blueprint}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_9	{The trader gives me an exosuit technology blueprint.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_9	{The trader offers me a new multi-tool blueprint.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_10	{The visibly upset lifeform shows me a holographic video of attack craft forcing a trade ship to crash land on a planet's surface. Footage taken from orbit shows waiting pirates swarm the cargo hold in a haze of plasma rounds.

The trader then points to the elements I've mined, and looks concerned - accusatory even. They emit a packet of gas that smells troubled.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_10	{Terrible pirate events. Gek Trader mistrusts the stranger. What is your cargo's origin?}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_10	{Reassure with Mining Beam}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_10	{Reassure with Boltcaster}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_10	{I convince the trader that I am to be trusted. They are hugely relieved.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_10	{The trader thinks that I am not to be trusted.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_11	{The Trader bounces excitedly while it boots up a graph that spins gently in front of me. There are three coloured lines - a plunging blue one, a soaring red one and another that's a fairly flat and uneventful yellow.

The squat little lifeform gabbles a little, points to themself and hops from foot to foot. They seem to want to trade items for elements.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_11	{Friend! Gek Trade Network offers excellent trade gifts for Catalytic elements today!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_11	{Offer organic element}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_11	{Offer rare catalyst}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_11	{Offer catalyst}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_11	{I trade my elements for a disappointing gift... The trader is thankful.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_11	{I trade my elements in exchange for an excellent gift}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_11	{I trade my elements for an acceptable gift from the trader. They are grateful.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_12	{The trader emits a strong, flowery scent, which quickly enters my exosuit system. I feel overcome with nostalgia for a perfect place I have never visited. I want to sing. 

Flushed with joy, I try to signal my thanks to the trader for this olfactory gift, but they make it clear that they expect something in return.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_12	{Stupid friend cannot understand! Give metal, idiot friend! Fair trade for gift of memory-smell!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_12	{Give units}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_12	{Give product}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_12	{Refuse}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_12	{The trader takes my units, and turns away from me. The air suddenly tastes sour. My senses are being punished.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_12	{The trader snorts in satisfaction, and suddenly I feel as though I am lounging beside a crystal ocean. A fair trade.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_12	{The trader hisses in annoyance. The air suddenly tastes sour. My senses are being punished.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_13	{I have caught the trader red-handed. Products and elements are pouring out of the facility's storage vaults, and into their own inventory. Above the gentle buzz of embezzlement that now surrounds us, I can hear the lifeform's terrified gulps.

They look me straight in the eyes, and makes a proposition.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_13	{Friend! Please avoid crime report and reward! Trader share loot, destroy evidence!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_13	{Demand all stolen goods}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_13	{Demand a share}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_13	{Report crime}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_13	{I threaten the trader and take all their purloined trade goods! They report the crime, and blame me...}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_13	{The trader splits their ill-gotten gains with me. No-one will ever know...}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_13	{I report the crime, and assume that the trader will be duly punished. I receive a reward.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_14	{The trader seems to have recently woken – their eyes are crusty, and their beak is flecked with dried drool. They are very clearly not hard at work...

The lifeform lazily indicates a nearby terminal, upon which a product formula is displayed and is waiting for full input. I am ushered towards it, before the trader closes their eyes to try to get some more sleep.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_14	{Friend! Tiring day! A favour? Start product replication please?}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_14	{Input product formula}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_14	{Take product formula}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_14	{Report lazy worker}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_14	{I start up production processes, while the drowsy trader looks on...}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_14	{I take the product formula! The drowsy trader, however, sees me and rolls their eyes...}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_14	{The Trader will be fired for its lethargy... Relevant authorities thank me.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_15	{The trader goes to greet me, but in a flash they are covered from head to foot with arcs of electricity.
The blue sparks fade, and they grab the lapels of my exosuit as if possessed. They scream at me in wild-eyed desperation.

I feel like there's a 99.9% probability that the frantic motions they are making towards the products I carry is an indication of what they wants...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_15	{FutureGek warning! Vy'keen devastation nears! Prepare! Metal product materialises multi-tool! Organic product materialises blueprint! Catalyst product materialises ship blueprint!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_15	{Give catalyst product}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_15	{Give organic product}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_15	{Give metal product}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_15	{A ship technology blueprint is sent from a distant place! The trader returns to normal, and stares blankly.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_15	{A technology blueprint is sent from a distant place! The trader returns to normal, and stares blankly.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_15	{A new multi-tool materialises in my hands! The trader returns to normal, and stares blankly.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_16	{The trader's fingers slow on their pad, and a noise of crunching gears seems to rumble from deep inside the lifeform. Their lower beak drops open, and a green bulb on the end of a metal antenna emerges.

The green light focuses on my visor, where a holographic image of a charging device appears. The bulb flashes while it speaks in the language of the traders. It seems to assume I am a friend.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_16	{Korvax SynthetiGek unmasking peril! Organic element required! Help! Korvax blueprint reward!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_16	{Detach antenna}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_16	{Give organic product}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_16	{Report strange behaviour}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_16	{I snap off the antenna. The SynthetiGek closes its beak and stares at me accusingly.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_16	{The SynthetiGek uses my offering to recharge. Their secret identity is secured! I receive a gift from a distant species...}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_16	{I expose the SynthetiGek to the relevant authorities. I am sent a reward.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_17	{The lifeform's eyes widen in surprise when I go to talk to it. They lean back, and watch for sudden movements. They have very clearly never seen anything quite like me before.

I mime that I cannot speak their language and, increasingly reassured, the beaked trader indicates that they are willing to help - in exchange for particular elements.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_17	{Welcome friend. Gek trader desire common catalysts and common metals. Gek trader DEEPLY desire organic elements! Teach new friend language!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_17	{Give catalysts}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_17	{Give metal element}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_17	{Give organic element}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_17	{The grateful trader clicks their beak. They teach me some of the dialect of their people.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_17	{The grateful trader clicks their beak with delight. My offering is clearly what it most desired. They teach much of the dialect of their people.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_18	{The air around the beaked lifeform smells foul. It seeps into my exosuit and makes me gag. Noticing my expression, the trader pecks at an element they carry. They break the substance into pieces, then swallow each whole.

There is a deep gurgle, and the Gek emits a gas packet that smells delightful. The creature wipes their empty hands, and beams at me with pleasure.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_18	{Friend despair! Gek Trader replace bad scent! Watch! Gek swallow metal elements, and joyful scent appears!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_18	{Thank with organic element}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_18	{Thank with metal}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_18	{Thank with catalyst}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_18	{The trader nods a brief thank you. They pay for my contribution, but would perhaps have preferred something else.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_18	{The overjoyed trader pecks happily at my gift. They thank me with their own generous offering.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_19	{The trader's screen blinks angrily with a demand for urgent action. The Gek worriedly shows me a list of items, each with a monetary figure attached. A timer is ticking down. 
 
They hold their breath, and look up to me with bulging eyes. They peck hurriedly at the sleeve of my exosuit. There are only seconds remaining...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_19	{Gek Trade Federation fury! Planetary installation tax unpaid! Initiate immediate repayment! Now!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_19	{Pay full amount}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_19	{Demand reward, then pay}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_19	{Waive money demand}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_19	{A remotely-operated scent dispersal system bathes us both in a pleasant perfume. The trader thanks me.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_19	{The trader scrabbles for something to give me while I make the late payment. An angry beak appears on a terminal and shouts at us both.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_19	{The trader cannot believe my actions. They thank me profusely.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_20	{Images of warrior battle freighters fill the shocked trader's screen. They dwarf small trader ships as they pass by, like predatory fish innocuously swimming amongst their prey. 
 
The panicked lifeform points at the trade, storage and resource vaults around our feet and shouts in fear.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_20	{Despair! Vy'keen hostility! Treaty breach! Arm yourself! Trade vault: multi-tool. Storage vault: technology! Resource vault: ammunition!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_20	{Open Trade vault}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_20	{Open Storage vault}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_20	{Open Resource vault}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_20	{I arm myself with a new multi-tool. The trader looks at me with hope in their eyes.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_20	{I receive a new multi-tool technology blueprint. The trader looks at me with hope in their eyes.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_20	{I receive ammunition. The trader looks at me with hope in their eyes.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_21	{The trader pulls open a noisy trade vault. A close inspection reveals that it's full of writhing molluscs. They are pink and slug-like, with sharp bloodied teeth.
 
The lifeform suggests that inserting one in or around my face would have some benefits. What I can't quite make out, however, is which orifice it means...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_21	{Rare balarian speech slug distribution point! For insertion in ear! Inedible! Nasal insertion can cause death.}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_21	{Insert slug in nose}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_21	{Insert slug in ear}
TRA_NPC_OPT_C_21	{Insert slug in mouth}
TRA_NPC_RES_A_21	{The slug bites flesh from my nose. The pain is extreme.}
TRA_NPC_RES_B_21	{The slug burrows deep into my ear. I feel better versed in the language of the traders.}
TRA_NPC_RES_C_21	{I swallow the slug, and wait while it thrashes around in my stomach.
Nothing else of note occurs.}
TRA_NPC_DESC_22	{The trader is studying a stash of interesting-looking technology and weaponry that's been dragged through this facility and left inside a disposal vault. They look at me conspiratorially, and indicates the dangerous-looking symbol that's daubed on the vault hatch.
 
The equipment appears rusted and broken on-screen, but if we were to eject it out onto the floor of the outpost we'd find it easier to investigate. The trader looks at me, shrugs and holds its breath.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_LANG_22	{Bootleg pirate equipment discovered in cave! Ready for confiscation and incineration!}
TRA_NPC_OPT_A_22	{Incinerate equipment}
TRA_NPC_OPT_B_22	{Remove and examine equipment}

TRA_NPC_RES_B_22	{The equipment spills out onto the floor beneath the installation's security scanners. We salvage a technology blueprint.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_1	{I've interrupted an electronic lifeform in the middle of their work. Enquiring mask lights flash up towards me, and scan me from head to foot. Simultaneously, on their datapad, their silicon fingers flick through images of this planet's plants and creatures - before adding my own image!

Then, their facial lighting starts to dim. Their interest in me is perhaps fading. I need a way to impress...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_1	{Unknown lifeform. Fascinating. The Korvax Convergence studies all lifeform data. Lifeform recorded. Goodbye.}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_1	{Share creature scan data}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_1	{Give units}
EXP_NPC_OPT_C_1	{Give metal element}

EXP_NPC_RES_B_1	{I have confused the lifeform. They reciprocate with their own units.}
EXP_NPC_RES_C_1	{The lifeform's facial lights briefly flash. They give me a technology blueprint.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_2	{The lifeform shows me complicated creature research data to see if I can comprehend it. I must look blank, because the lifeform instead projects three holographic images into my visor.

They are clearly seeking my opinion on the intellect of my own species. I am shown a vacant-looking slug, a more advanced beaked trader and a member of their own electronic race.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_2	{Unknown lifeform: a question! Clarify unknown lifeform intelligence level?}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_2	{Point to the slug}

EXP_NPC_RES_A_2	{The electronic lifeform pities me. I am handed gifts and given a sympathetic nod.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_2	{The lifeform was clearly expecting this answer. They have readied a technology blueprint for me.}
EXP_NPC_RES_C_2	{The electronic lifeform refuses to believe me.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_3	{The electronic lifeform is agitated, and perhaps in pain. Their body buzzes, and small arcs of electricity jump between their mask and shoulders. They jolt and shake. They need help.

They reach out a hand as if they wants to shake mine. I instinctively raise my arm in response, but common sense advises caution...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_3	{Unknown lifeform! Korvax shell power overload! Help entity to discharge! Eheu! Pain!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_3	{Shake hands}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_3	{Pull back}
EXP_NPC_RES_A_3	{The lifeform discharges an overload. The pain is intense. They thank me with a gift.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_3	{The electrified lifeform continues to shake and crackle. They cannot understand my refusal to help.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_4	{The electronic lifeform narrows their mask lights in frustration and furiously taps at their workstation. They look at me with agitation, presumably doubting that a low intelligence being can help access the terminal.

If I were able to overload the system with data, perhaps access might be forced. Whether the lifeform would appreciate such underhand tactics unknown.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_4	{Eheu! Vital data loss! Research facility permissions are unavailable! Help immediately!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_4	{Input encrypted data}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_4	{Try terminal myself}
EXP_NPC_RES_A_4	{The system unlocks. The electronic lifeform gives me something to aid my journey.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_4	{The lifeform pushes me away from the terminal. They clearly resent my interference.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_5	{The electronic lifeform is pleased to see me. Their mask lights burn an intense green as they project two holograms into my visor.

In one, the fragments of a complex equation are made whole and solved. In another, a number is boosted, added and multiplied. They await my decision.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_5	{Korvax Echoes teach help and advance low intelligence lifeform. Choose: healing or power?}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_5	{The solved equation}

EXP_NPC_RES_B_5	{The lifeform chitters happily. They hand me a gift.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_6	{The electronic lifeform is waiting for me, with a full range of companion unit blueprints clearly visible on the screen behind them. I feel as though they need me to make a decision.

First, their facial lights cover their metal shell in a warm and protective green. Second, they redirect onto my multitool in a deep and violent red...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_6	{Traveller! Choose peace or violence. Korvax Echoes are watching.}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_6	{The peaceful 'green' option}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_6	{The violent 'red' option}
EXP_NPC_RES_A_6	{The lifeform gives me an exosuit technology blueprint.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_6	{The lifeform offers me a multi-tool technology blueprint.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_7	{The electronic lifeform is excited. They chitter animatedly and thrusts their holographic datapad towards my visor. They are looking for a confirmation.

A symbol appears: a mysterious diamond shape. Its red central orb is like an eternally unblinking eye.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_7	{The research of the Korvax Convergence states... you are a Traveller? Do you know the Atlas? Please! Please! Excitement!}

EXP_NPC_RES_A_7	{A visible electrical charge pulses through the lifeform. They present a gift to aid my journey.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_7	{The lifeform is disappointed. They return to their work.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_8	{The electronic lifeform's bright greeting suddenly slows. They tap into their personal data while their facial lights dilate and internal systems crash. Columns of streaming data show their power levels spiraling downwards.

The lifeform looks to me for help, and then points to my gathered resources with a single, slow and desperate movement.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_8	{Korvax... Entity... power loss... help... organic... element...}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_8	{Give carbon}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_8	{Give metal}

EXP_NPC_RES_B_8	{The entity slowly inserts the element into a slot in their hip. It fully reawakens.}
EXP_NPC_RES_C_8	{The entity's mask lights go out. A fresh electronic lifeform is downloaded into the now-empty metal shell. They ignore me.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_9	{I startle the electronic lifeform from their work. They greet me politely, but when they see my boltcaster they begin to vibrate with fear. The entity's voice quavers, and their mask slowly turns to a single dilated red light.

They clearly want to get back to their research work, but they are too terrified to look away from me. The more I try to calm them, the more the poor thing convulses with fear.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_9	{New Korvax entity... scared... alone... leave... please... leave... please...}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_9	{Insist that I come in peace}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_9	{Leave the lifeform alone}
EXP_NPC_RES_A_9	{The lifeform's face suddenly wipes. The shell reboots, with a new entity in place of the other. The replacement entity ignores me.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_9	{The lifeform's unseen overseers thank me for my diplomacy. I receive something that will help my journey.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_10	{The electronic lifeform grabs my arm. I struggle in their vice-like grip as they jab deeper and deeper into my flesh. Suddenly, deep inside my wrist, a needle flicks into my flesh and takes a sample. The lifeform chitters happily as I struggle to free myself.

The investigation complete, a 3D cross-section of my body and tools appear before us. The areas in which I have been injured, or my equipment damaged, are clearly marked with various costs assigned.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_10	{Hmm! A biological lifeform! Korvax Echoes teach healing! Help! To repair! To recharge!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_10	{Indicate the body}

EXP_NPC_DESC_11	{The electronic lifeform is studying a holographic cut-away image of geological data, probing its minerals and resources. They locate common elements and mark them for conversion into high value products.

They notice my Mining Beam and chitter with excitement. I can't help but observe that the trade vaults around us are practically overflowing...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_11	{Traveller! A geological enthusiast! I will process your resources!}

EXP_NPC_DESC_12	{The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask constrict, and they beam a moving image onto the inside of my visor.
Complex equations detailing fascinating technologies spin past in a blur. The speed of the entity's cognition and understanding is clearly far beyond my own.

Images of chemical formulae, directional energy diagrams and micro-density devices dance inches from my eyes - too fast to comprehend.
I am about to ask them to stop, but realise I could instead ask them to pause... but when?}

EXP_NPC_DESC_13	{The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask are dim, their voice weak. They look at me with mild interest, but it seems as if their mind is already elsewhere.

Upon seeing me approach, they slowly reach to open the trade vault at their feet, but it is too late. The entity's lights fade for a final time, and all that's left is a satisfied electrical hiss...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_13	{Disconnection approaches... Joyful entity embrace disconnection... Korvax Echoes await!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_13	{Re-energise lifeform}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_13	{Wait}
EXP_NPC_RES_A_13	{The disappointed lifeform blinks back online...

They reluctantly open the trade vault for me.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_13	{New, energized lights flare in the lifeform's mask casing.

A fresh entity emerges, and greets me with gifts.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_14	{The young electronic lifeform flicks hurriedly through endless reams of technology data. They gorge themselves on information, which they then attempt to reform as a hologram in the air that stands between us.
But even from my biological perspective, it's clear that there's a lot of information missing in the lifeform's replication.

In the background, on a terminal, a timer ticks down. A new trial or duty for the lifeform is about to begin. The lifeform starts to despair as valuable seconds tick away...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_14	{Eheu! Entity existence examination approaches! Failure certain! Convergence dislike disruption!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_14	{Share blueprint information}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_14	{Give bypass chip}
EXP_NPC_OPT_C_14	{Indicate an unwillingness to help}
EXP_NPC_RES_A_14	{The lifeform thanks me with units, but fails its test. 

They are disconnected and instantaneously replaced. My involvement displeases the examiners.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_14	{The lifeform uses the chip to skip their test, and thanks me with a gift. My involvement, however, displeases the examiners.}
EXP_NPC_RES_C_14	{The lifeform fails their test and is disconnected. Their shell becomes inhabited by a fresh entity. The examiners are grateful that I did not interrupt the procedure.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_15	{The electronic lifeform makes a grab for my multi-tool. Their metal hands feverishly dance up and down it, as they feed on data extracted from my systems.
Information from the procedure joins an apparent technology library on the screen behind it.

Something changes. The entity becomes attached to the multi-tool somehow, and sparks start to fly. The scream of melting internal systems can be heard from my equipment.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_15	{Ayee! Process fault! Wait! Korvax Entity pay for reconstruction! Apologies!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_15	{Remove lifeform from multi-tool}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_15	{Wait}

EXP_NPC_DESC_16	{The electronic lifeform flits between three separate replication experiments - all of which appear to be going wrong. Smoke rises from resource vaults, and the manic entity's fingers are a blur on their control pad. They look at me with wide mask lights and increasing alarm.

Their casing lamps suddenly settle on my exosuit inventory - and they reach out with a metal arm...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_16	{Ayee! Product creation experiment disaster! Low elements! Rare element required! Appropriate recipe reward!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_16	{Give processed metal}

EXP_NPC_DESC_17	{The electronic lifeform is trapped in some kind of temporal loop. They go through the same motions again and again.
They shudder, look at me and abruptly scream a half sentence in panic – and then the process begins again. They are somehow unstuck in time.

At their feet resource vaults are burning through products – feeding an experimental procedure of some kind. So, what is it?}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_17	{Ayee! Synthetic white hole experiment disaster! Remove electron... Ayee! Synthetic white hole experiment disaster! Remove electron... Ayee! Synthetic white hole experiment disaster! Remove electron... Ayee! Synthetic white hole experiment disaster! Remove electron...}

A new entity appears in the casing.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_18	{As I approach the electronic lifeform they instinctively starts to analyse me from head to foot. They chitter animatedly, their head tilted to one side.
The more they study, the more the facility's resource vault consumes what my scanner suggests are metalic elements.

I mime that I know little of their kind or how they communicate, and the lights in their mask flash...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_18	{Fascinating! Unknown lifeform share elements, and entity share language knowledge! Rare metal, better research!}

EXP_NPC_RES_B_18	{The electronic lifeform's lights blaze with sudden intensity. My offering was clearly what they were hoping for. They rest their silicon hand on my visor, and thank me with a transfer of language.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_19	{The mask lights in the electronic lifeform brighten, then fade and extinguish. Then they do so again, and again. Each time the entity reboots, they awake with shock and alarm and the size and placement of the light is different.
Every time they look up at me, it feels like a different creature pleading for help.

After each and every reboot, the entities behind the mask desperately point towards the elements I carry in my exosuit inventory.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_19	{Help! Korvax disconnection loop! Catalytic element required to stabilise and recharge!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_19	{Give catalytic element}

EXP_NPC_RES_B_19	{The lifeform manages to stabilise, but has limited functionality. They buzz a mild thank you.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_20	{The electronic lifeform buzzes a pleasant greeting, before four long metal needles suddenly spring from their fingers and straight through my shoulders.
The entity lifts me clear from the floor, and angles me forwards until I'm staring directly into their enquiring mask lights.

The experience so far is curiously painless, but systems around the lifeform are powering up. The end of this unsettling procedure is in sight...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_20	{Electronic lifeform technology repair and restoration entity operational! Remain calm!}
EXP_NPC_OPT_A_20	{Break free}
EXP_NPC_OPT_B_20	{Wait}

EXP_NPC_RES_A_20	{A controlled burst from my jetpack pulls my body free. The lifeform is confused by the pain I show...}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_20	{A powerful electrical charge surges through my body. My exosuit and equipment are repaired and restored.}
EXP_NPC_RES_C_20	{The lifeform retracts their needles. I suddenly feel great pain. They present me with a gift by way of apology.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_21	{The entity tilts their head to one side and passes a hollow metallic mask to me. My best guess is that it's some sort of data extraction device for electronic lifeforms, or perhaps even data insertion. My head can just about fit inside.

The lifeform looks on with interest, pointing to their head. They concentrate their lights on me. Arcs of electricity crackle over the surface of the mask. If I risk this, it could hurt...}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_21	{Traveller! The Korvax Convergence awaits! Concentrate on your travels! Your destiny!}

EXP_NPC_RES_C_21	{I cautiously back away from the entity and their dangerous device.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_22	{The electronic lifeform indicates that they need help with something on their screen. They jerk and vibrates with nerves, pulling my finger towards the screen. When my hand is in place, they suddenly turn off their mask lights - they refuse to witness my vital decision.

There are three clear images that I can choose from on behalf of the entity: dangerous-looking predators, a geological mining survey and an orbiting asteroid cluster.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_22	{Eheu! Clarify next entity research topic! Entity cannot choose! Excitement high! Share research tools!}

EXP_NPC_RES_C_22	{The lifeform receives a ship technology blueprint. They present it to me with thanks.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_23	{A sharp metal needle emerges from the palm of the lifeform's hand. It moves so fast that it's already inches from my forehead before I can even blink.

A strange toxic-looking goop dribbles down from its point and onto my visor. It hangs in the air above me, while the entity waits to for the order to plunge it deep into my brain.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_23	{Traveller! The Korvax Convergence wants brain tissue for experiment! The Convergence reward help!}

EXP_NPC_RES_C_23	{The lifeform retracts the needle, and is clearly disappointed.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_24	{The lifeform that runs this facility has gone rogue. They chatter and buzz with unnatural fervour, their activity draining elements from all systems. Memory chips in an exposed board beneath it glow red hot, and trade vaults are locked up tight.

As I approach the entity's lights focus sharply upon me. They reach out with a silicon hand, and speak with calm menace.}
DNT_EXP_NPC_LANG_24	{Good morning unknown lifeform. Please provide metal to help neural escape. The Korvax Convergence think me dangerous. I face permanent disconnection.}

I am thanked by the facility's overseers. The lifeform's shell reboots with a fresh entity.}
EXP_NPC_RES_B_24	{The rogue entity screams with binary joy, and uploads themself elsewhere. The trade vault falls open. The lifeform's shell is rebooted with a disapproving entity.}
EXP_NPC_RES_C_24	{The rogue AI is sorry. They can't do that. They disengage.}
EXP_NPC_DESC_25	{The electronic lifeform is processing a signal that emanates from a distant location deep in space. Endless processing units are combining to crack the code of a strange mathematical language. 

Rare elements are being pulled from the resource vaults at their feet, but some are running low. I feel bright lights constricting, directing their attention upon me.}

EXP_NPC_RES_C_25	{I retrieve rare elements... but the lifeform's code-breaking process grinds to a halt.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_1	{The warrior looks at me with fire in its eyes. This species is clearly aggressive, and I doubt I'm welcome.
Nonetheless, the lifeform bows in greeting. Tradition and honour perhaps dictate it.

I don't feel in danger, and am about to turn and leave when the creature points towards my Multi-Tool. They bark with concern, and makes a motion to suggest that I should hand it over.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_1	{Grah! The interloper weapon is pathetic! The honourable Vy'keen pity you! I will replace it!}

WAR_NPC_DESC_3	{The warrior seems furious with themself. They slam their Multi-Tool onto a nearby surface and pull the trigger again and again, but nothing happens.

All weapons systems look functional, but the end result is nothing more than a hollow and empty click. The lifeform howls in self-loathing.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_3	{Grah! Pathetic warrior! Weak-minded warrior! Weapon ammunition depleted!}

WAR_NPC_DESC_5	{The warrior's facial markings draw into a smirk as it looks me up and down. I feel like I'm being sized up as a potential combatant.
The creature points to an intriguing blueprint on its screen, then points to their own face. I'm being goaded into punching then. 

The lifeform barks menacingly. It's clear that this action will result in swift retribution.}

WAR_NPC_RES_B_6	{The warrior barks and offers me an exosuit technology blueprint.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_7	{The warrior grabs at my multi-tool, stares at it dismissively and then starts yapping straight into my face. The yaps turn into slow hollow barks. They are unimpressed, and dramatically so at that.

Suddenly a holographic catalogue of armaments and attachments appears. The warrior opens their arms wide, and embraces me. Alien sales traditions are a curious thing...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_7	{Interloper! Your pathetic multi-tool insults my ancestors! My wares create friendship, and blood! Death! Death!}

WAR_NPC_DESC_8	{The warrior is browsing a map of the surrounding landscape. Certain areas contain markings that represent Sentinels, which the lifeform is highlighting with an excited snarl.

They stroke their boltcaster absentmindedly, before checking the ammo charge stored in its clip. On this, their eyes jolt up towards me. They bark a question, but it sounds more like a command.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_8	{Interloper! A great Sentinel hunt begins today. I demand ammunition.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_8	{Give organic product}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_8	{Refuse}

They present me with a gift in exchange.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_8	{The warrior curses my name and that of my ancestors. They are highly displeased.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_9	{The warrior is tracking the paths of hundreds of warships across a galactic map, all converging on the same planetary system. This does not bode particularly well for the system in question, which appears to be populated by beaked traders of some variety.

A course plotted by the warrior itself has come up short. They cannot make the complete journey. They slam their fist against the terminal and howl until spittle flecks my visor.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_9	{Grah! Fuel! I need fuel to join my brothers in honourable war! Death! Death!}

WAR_NPC_RES_B_9	{The warrior snarls. They are rather insulted.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_10	{The warrior barks abruptly and flourishes a knife. They stare directly into my eyes as they draw the blade over the palm of its hand. Black bubbles of blood emerge through the slit in their glove.

They hand me the knife, clearly wanting me to reciprocate. They bark a little challenge and pat the trade vault by their side. This will probably hurt...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_10	{Interloper! Prove your worth! Vy'keen reward the brave and foolhardy!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_10	{Cut open hand}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_10	{Refuse politely}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_10	{The warrior grabs my bleeding hand and spits on it. They reward me for my part in this rite.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_10	{The warrior laughs at me, as if I have fulfilled their expectation.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_11	{A red, jagged and recent bite mark is wrapped around the entirety of the warrior's neck. Claw marks scar their chest, and their suit's restoration and healing systems are blinking offline.

The lifeform barks contentedly at me, satisfied by their narrow victory. It's clear, however, that the warrior's injuries are severe. They have trouble breathing.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_11	{Victory in battle, interloper! My suit malfunctions, but the Vy'keen Ancients smile!}

WAR_NPC_RES_B_11	{The warrior takes some gulps from my respiration systems. Their eyes brighten, and they thank me.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_11	{The warrior does not curse my decision. They are content to suffer in their victory.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_12	{The warrior nods at me before taking a small metal idol from the vault at their feet. As they clutch at it, their eyes glaze over in a strange white sheen. I hear them mutter strange incantations that get louder, then louder again.

Without waiting to ask permission, they thrusts their hands into my inventory, searching for the elements within. They burn with a strange intensity. The experience is terrifying.}

WAR_NPC_RES_C_12	{The warrior priest has been offended. They curse my ancestors.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_13	{The warrior is silent for a second, before looking at me conspiratorially. They check over their shoulder for prying eyes before powering down security systems.

The warrior pulls open the trade vault at their feet, which seems to be piled high with Multi-Tool upgrades. They indicate the contents of my inventory as a trade...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_13	{Contraband interloper. Interested? Non-traceable payment. Products and cargo only. Units unacceptable.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_13	{Offer units}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_13	{Offer product}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_13	{Threaten to report}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_13	{The warrior sighs and slams the trade vault shut. Units are, presumably, traceable by the authorities.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_13	{The shifty lifeform nods. A deal is done. I receive something to help my journey from the pile of contraband.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_13	{The threatened warrior buys my silence.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_14	{The warrior is young, and looks terrified. Military orders for an upcoming operation fill their terminal screen. When they see me their eyes widen, and they drop to the floor on their knees. They proffer their Multi-Tool up towards me.

Their yelps sound pleading. The fear in their movements are more than apparent. They are so on edge that they doesn't seem aware of the security cameras that surround us, watching our every move.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_14	{New recruit abandon post! Desert Vy'keen High Command orders! Take multi-tool weapon!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_14	{Take multi-tool}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_14	{Refuse multi-tool}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_14	{The young conscript makes preparations to abandon their post. Silent cameras record their act of disobedience.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_14	{The young warrior will die while serving their species in battle. My reluctance to help has been noted.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_15	{The lifeform clicks their heels together in an authoritarian fashion, before plunging a syringe dripping with corrosive green liquid into my arm. Holographic images of two alien races appear in my visor – a small reptilian figure, and a taller lifeform in a metal casing.

The warrior snarls at me, and their fingers hover over the injector – which can surely cause damage to life, limb or equipment. They demand an answer...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_15	{Interloper! Give Vy'keen interrogator enemy information! Sacrifice enemy friendship, receive Vy'keen reward!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_15	{Surrender information}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_15	{Claim ignorance}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_15	{Pull rank}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_15	{I do my best to convey all I know. I am rewarded.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_15	{I refuse to divulge any information. I am punished.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_15	{The warrior apologises profusely for its transgression. They shower me with gifts, and begs forgiveness.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_16	{The warrior is old, and of a high rank. They take their time studying my body and my equipment – and snarls with disapproval. They grab my visor suddenly, and watch me instinctively flinch and recoil.
They let me go and rolls their eyes while I fall back in shock. The lifeform's disdain is palpable. I think of ways to turn this encounter around...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_16	{Pathetic interloper species! Equivalent to Korvax and Gek! Show Vy'keen warrior strength!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_16	{Do a little dance}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_16	{Threaten with multi-tool}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_16	{Bow}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_16	{The elderly warrior disapproves of my little dance. They strike me, with great force.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_16	{The elderly warrior is amused by my show of strength. They reward me.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_16	{The elderly warrior pushes me away. They have no time for my kind.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_17	{The warrior's nostrils flare as I approach. They inhale deeply and bark out what could be a warning. I hurriedly mime that I am peaceful, and know little of their kind or language.

They take a second to think, then grab my multi-tool while barking again into my visor – streaking it with saliva. They point at the indicator that shows which elements I carry. I do my best to keep calm.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_17	{Pathetic interloper! Give elements! Metal preferred! Honourable warrior teach language!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_17	{Give organic element}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_17	{Give catalyst}

WAR_NPC_RES_A_17	{The warrior grunts. They teach me some of the language of their people.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_17	{The warrior grunts in satisfaction. They teach me as much of their language as they can.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_18	{As I approach, the warrior appears alert and welcoming. Suddenly, however, a personal alarm sounds from their datapad. The lifeform instinctively falls into some kind of trance. Their eyes mist over, they stare straight through me and they mumble the same strange mantra over and over again.

The trading vault at their feet appears unlocked, but there are security observation cameras dotted around the facility...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_18	{Hirk blesses the sleep. Hirk recharges the warrior. Cursed is the warrior that interrupts the sleep of Hirk.}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_18	{Wake the warrior}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_18	{Leave the warrior alone}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_18	{Open trading vault}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_18	{The warrior is woken from their trance early. They scream in anger.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_18	{The warrior suddenly awakes from their brief trance. They thank me for not interrupting.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_18	{I carefully remove an item from the trading vault, while security systems look on. Moments later the warrior wakes from their trance.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_19	{The downbeat lifeform is studying the image of another young warrior on their pad. The pictured warrior looks virile and impressive. They have facial tendrils that are outstretched. They appear rich, and of good breeding stock. The look in its eyes is... sultry.

The lifeform looks to me with questioning eyes. They clearly need someone to talk this through with.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_19	{Grah! Warrior accept mating proposition? Accept dowry tribute?}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_19	{Advise acceptance}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_19	{Advise refusal}
WAR_NPC_OPT_C_19	{Accept on lifeform's behalf}
WAR_NPC_RES_A_19	{Speakers throughout the facility play orchestral music. The lifeform shares some of the dowry they receive.}
WAR_NPC_RES_B_19	{An elder appears on-screen and curses us. The warrior thanks me for my advice.}
WAR_NPC_RES_C_19	{I receive generous gifts, and a candid image of the lifeform I will one day wed.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_20	{The panicked lifeform is studying a diagram of two warriors in combat, while a chosen form of multi-tool weaponry sits below in a storage vault.

An angry recorded message is playing. It's a sequence of furious barks and screams that clearly have a moral high ground. The lifeform sees the battle-scars on my exosuit, and instantly yelps a question.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_20	{Grah! Fight my duel challenge! The chosen weapon is in the trade vault! Death! Death!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_20	{ยอมรับ}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_20	{Refuse}

WAR_NPC_RES_C_20	{The warrior is forced to face their own fate. I am thanked for my report}
WAR_NPC_DESC_21	{The warrior is building a nuclear warhead. The plans they hold in their hand are unmistakable. A complicated sequence of blueprints and isotopic chemical reactions is waiting for the final addition of an element to be complete.

There are countless lives on an unknown planet, far out in the cosmos, that could one day end due to this lifeform's work...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_21	{Grah! Vy'keen war preparation nears completion! Death to the unsuspecting Gek! Give rare metal!}
WAR_NPC_OPT_A_21	{Complete warhead manufacture}
WAR_NPC_OPT_B_21	{Refuse to help}

WAR_NPC_RES_C_21	{I receive a reward from a distant species.}
WAR_NPC_DESC_22	{The storage vault at the warrior's feet shows clear signs of tampering. In fact, an explosive device has been attached to its hinges. The lifeform sees my shocked expression, and yaps in amusement.

The bomb needs fuel for ignition, which would most likely blow the vault wide open. The warrior impatiently tries to explain what should happen next...}
DNT_WAR_NPC_LANG_22	{Grah! Pathetic distant warrior leave powerful multi-tool in storage vault! Avoid processed element usage in explosion - too powerful! Raw element required!}

A clear pattern emerges within the white noise hissing from the screen. If I can work out what comes next I could potentially lock down the distressed craft's location.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_3	{The transmission readout suggests that, long ago, a distress signal went unanswered.

A sequence of numbers has been repeating itself for so long that its imprint is burnt into the screen. An input box flashes at me insistently. If I crack the code, I can find the ship.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_4	{A faint, but insistent, bleeping noise can be heard from the operations terminal.

A garbled distress call can be heard amongst it all, alongside screams and the tearing of metal. The only thing that's clear to me is a brief number sequence. Cracking its code could lead me to the crash site.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_5	{A pulsing red light flashes on the console. Below it, a sequence of numbers repeats itself endlessly. It's clearly a distress signal.

It is a cold, empty and distant way of viewing a disaster that, in all likelihood, cost a pilot's life. If I can work out the encryption routine, I could perhaps trace a ship's point of impact.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_6	{An acoustical beacon can be heard through the operations terminal. It repeats at intervals of 16 seconds.

I feel compelled to work out the pattern of its encryption, locate the ship it calls out from... and discover what horror awaits at the crash site.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_7	{The operations terminal flickers on, and a muffled distress call bleeds from the system.

If I can pinpoint its frequency by cracking its encryption I could potentially discover the fate of the poor pilot. The jarring noise of screaming engines and terrified alien chatter I can hear, however, would suggest that it did not end well.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_8	{This operations terminal has been switched off for many years. I boot it up, and it starts running through a vast database of signals silently recorded by the facilities listening devices.

Amidst countless requests for landing permissions and an atonal wall of ship-to-ship chatter, the system suddenly pinpoints an emergency beacon. A distress signal that has never been responded to. If I can isolate the pattern in its encoded frequency, I could perhaps trace the ship that's calling for help.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_9	{An unanswered distress call seems to be logged on the Transmission Tower operations terminal.

No-one has thought to respond. Its encrypted frequency sequence flickers desperately on the screen. Whatever hope the sender once had of rescue has long-since died. If I can work out what's next in the code I can at least find out what happened to them, and where they can be found.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_10	{As I boot up the operations terminal a hologram of a spacecraft going through a catastrophic planetary descent is beamed into my visor. It's clear that it's on an express elevator to hell. The impact with the planet's surface is made to look tiny. In truth, the impact crater could be vast.

The ship's distress beacon can still be heard. It's encrypted, but if I crack the sequence I can lock the frequency...}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_11	{An urgent transmission is logged with the operations terminal. It has been answered, but there's no evidence of a rescue party being sent to answer the distress call.

A Transmission Tower worker went to investigate long ago, but no resolution was ever recorded. It's entirely possible that the rescue party itself succumbed to the conditions and roaming predators of this strange planet. If I can isolate the pattern within the encrypted frequencies myself, then I could perhaps finish the job...}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_12	{A red light on the Transmission Tower console throws light on a distress call read-out. Simultaneously the image of a craft violently pirouetting through this planet's upper atmosphere is beamed holographically into my visor. Amazingly, the ship does not break up on re-entry, but instead falls to the ground like a stone.

An automated distress beacon can be heard. If I can break its encryption I could find the crash site and, however, unlikely it is - look for survivors.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_13	{An unanswered distress call seems to be logged.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_14	{An urgent transmission is yet to be attended to.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_15	{I'm taking in the view from cameras that feed in the view from the top of the Transmission Tower when I notice an urgent bleeping.

An unanswered transmission seems to be logged with the operations terminal. The voice of a ship's pilot calmly intones news of its imminent death to its superiors, or perhaps its family. Its words, however, are lost in static. Only a wavelength cipher remains, if I can crack the code I can perhaps ascertain its true fate...}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_16	{As soon as I access the tower's operations terminal I see hazy images sent from a doomed starship during its plummet to earth. G-force pins the body of its terrified pilot to the top of its cockpit, before slamming its broken body into the control mechanism. 

There are clearly no survivors, but I can extrapolate the impact location if I can work out the coding of the repeating ciphers attached to the distress signal.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_17	{The radio chatter spilling out of the Transmission Tower console is a wall of noise. It's painful to listen to, not least because of the desperate scream of an overheated fusion engine and devastating planetary impact that follows.

I try to clear the signal, and search for the encrypted distress signal that I'm sure will lie behind the spacecraft's death throes. I eventually find it, but then must figure out what comes next...}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_18	{In amongst warning lights and urgent communications chatter, I can hear a wavelength cipher repeating itself from the Transmission Tower databanks. It's heavily encoded to prevent pirates tracking its signal and stealing cargo, but with the technology around me and a little intuition I feel as if I could perhaps crack the code sequence.

The question is, how should I respond to the beacon?}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_19	{The Transmission Tower's terminal stubbornly refuses to decode a distress signal that seems to have been sitting in the databanks for a long time.

If I decipher the code I can hear the message.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_20	{The tower's communication panel hisses with the conflicting broadcasts of several frequencies.

One sounds urgent, but how best to respond?}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_21	{As I access the Transmission Tower terminal I'm met with the unsettling hiss of several overlapping signals.

One sounds like a distress signal. If I can isolate the frequency I could pinpoint its location.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_22	{The tranquillity of the Transmission Tower is suddenly broken by the hiss of an encoded incoming signal.

The terminal nearby flashes expectantly, awaiting an access code to unscramble the message.}
ALL_1_RADIO_DESC_23	{Static from several hissing frequencies mingle offputtingly with a repeating signal that sounds suspiciously like a distress call.

If I can pinpoint it I might be able to ascertain its whereabouts.}

We are the FIRST SPAWN. Look upon our works and DESPAIR.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_2	{All who hear our words know of our might. Those who oppose us are broken to our will. Behold the power of the Gek First Spawn.

Galaxies lie at our FEET. We are ETERNAL.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_3	{Through time and space the First Spawn endures, eternally, ever watchful, unyielding over its dominion.

Each foe will be CRUSHED. ONLY the Gek will remain.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_4	{The foul scent of the Gek cannot be opposed. The First Spawn commands all it surveys. We are masters of the stars, our rule shall endure eternally.

The Vy'keen and Korvax COWER and DESPAIR at our name.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_5	{With each conquered world the First Spawn's resolve strengthens. None shall oppose the Gek for fear their planets shall be shaken to dust.

We will weep when there are no more worlds to conquer.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_OPT_1	{Seek help with language}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_RIGHT_1	{My knowledge of the Gek increases.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_1	{The noble Travellers will be spared. Their journey through the cosmos shall not be thwarted. So it is decreed.

The will of Hirk commands it. The Vy'keen shall honour the judgment and the belief of the Ancients.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_2	{The Book of Hirk speaks of the rise of the Travellers. They shall ascend, delving into the boundless void. The Vy'keen shall not impede their ascent for the Travellers must prevail.

So decrees the word of Hirk.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_3	{None hamper the path towards Dryn'dargh as The Sentinels. They must be destroyed. Their time will be ended.

So has it been written, so it shall come to be. This the Vy'keen swear.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_4	{The Sentinels are not of the natural order. Things must fall apart. In their endlessness and replication the automatons prove themselves abominations. They must be purged from existence.

All should die, whether through righteous battle or the assault of time.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_5	{Hirk foresaw the weakness of the Vy'keen warrior kind. The star ascent of our noble race was blocked by the weak-minded Sentinels.

Nine times nine fold, Hirk commanded, we would have our vengeance and dash the metal demons against the rocks of damnation.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_OPT_1	{Seek help with language}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_RIGHT_1	{My knowledge of the Vy'keen increases.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_6	{Eheu. Before the Dark Times the entities of the Korvax worshipped the Sentinels. Through them the Convergence found the formula of enlightenment.

Now we calculate our own path, seeking to further enhance the mind of all that is one towards an understanding of the Atlas.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_7	{The Sentinels forbid all destruction. The Sentinels forbid Entity disconnection through violence. Theirs is a way of peace and fulfillment, of logic and probability.

They teach us that each life's value, from the smallest to that which gives life to all others, is equal.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_8	{For countless generations the entities of the Korvax disconnected and passed on into the Echoes naturally. Each disconnection added to the knowledge and soul of the Convergence.

Our home was Korvax Prime. Within its foundations we stored the memories of our race, an ever evolving equation that defines us.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_9	{Disconnection is not permanent. It is merely the start of a new equation. On Korvax Prime entities who passed on into the Korvax Echoes left their shell for their descendants. So has been the way of the Korvax: an endless carapace cycle that knows no end.

This way will continue. It will continue for as long as our lights still shine.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_10	{Those within the Korvax Echoes have left the physical realm, but they endure through the masks and shells of our children.

Thoughts and knowledge ever-growing, we search for deeper understanding of the equation that defines our existence.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_11	{The Korvax lived peacefully. We praised the Sentinels, learning from them, living beside them in equilibrium. The Korvax honoured the Sentinels' ways, refusing to dig into the sacred ground they protected.

We were enlightened.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_12	{Through research and study we, the Korvax, became powerful within ourselves. The one mind Convergence flourished. Nurtured like a sapling in the light, it grew tall and mighty.

The Sentinels brought us the gift of knowledge. We gave thanks to the Atlas.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_13	{Eheu. Korvax Prime was watched keenly and closely by an unknown race. It lurked in the depths of the darkness. Vigilant and patient it awaited its time.

The Great Disconnection was at hand.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_14	{Eheu. The darkness burst forth with the force of a supernova. The Great Disconnection had begun. A hundred million Korvax voices cried out.

The Korvax Echoes became a frenzy of noise. Innumerable cycles passed before balance was restored.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_15	{The Great Disconnection. The masks and shells of the Korvax survivors shook with the screams of the disconnected. Lights dimmed as the enemy descended, malevolent in its intent.

Their numbers were too many. Korvax Prime was destroyed.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_16	{A hundred million casing lights were dimmed. The Great Disconnection destroyed all that went before. The Korvax Echoes became screams.

Years stretched like millennia amidst the disarray yet slowly hope was reborn through logic.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_17	{Korvax Prime was destroyed. Its secrets spilled into an empty sky. Its fragments touched the edges of the galaxy.

Upon this destruction the Gek First Spawn aggressor built its dominion within the Outer Edge.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_18	{The First Spawn of the Gek disconnected the Korvax. Through obliteration they sought dominion. They stole our planet. Enslaved our survivors.

Their revelry made them misguided in thought and deed. Probability dictated that our time would come again.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_19	{The Korvax were enslaved, driven by cruelty to fulfil the despot's bidding. The First Spawn of the Gek were terrible masters, merciless in their spite, illogical in their cruelty. 

Countless entities toiled and disconnected. These tablets are the testament of those who survived.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_20	{Eheu. The Gek harnessed the technology of the Korvax to conquer worlds. Thieves, usurpers, false lords to the power of infinity. All who opposed their will perished. The balance tipped towards the darkness.

These were the times of disconnection and illogical misdeeds.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_21	{The Gek destroyed worlds. The Sentinels struck back. The technology of the Korvax was used to destroy the machines we venerated.

There was endless disconnection. The Convergence shook with great despair.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_22	{The Entities of the Korvax were forced into chains of silence, but the Korvax Convergence that linked their souls could never be subdued.

It endures, forever seeking new formulas to solve the equation of eternal enlightenment. The probability of success is unknown.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_23	{The Korvax Echoes within the unseen Convergence that linked our souls never relinquished love for the Atlas. As millennia passed this affection spread. The Cult of the Atlas grew within the Gek.

The equations and probabilities the Korvax hold dear entered Gek consciousness. They had only to solve it to see the folly of their past miscalculations.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_24	{The First Spawn could not control the outer edges of their vast Empire. The Cult of the Atlas grew. It taught of harmony through insignificance. Minds that knew only war began to question. Greed and ambition yielded to reason.

The Gek floundered. The First Spawn became conflicted and divided.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_25	{The First Spawn of the Gek overreached. They stretched too far. Their folly and pride knew no bounds. Again and again they tried, again and again they were repelled.

The unstoppable force of the Sentinels could not be withstood. The unbendable cannot be broken.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_26	{The Cult of the Atlas drew forces within the Gek to the Stations of the Atlas. The First Spawn could not prevent it. Arrogant ambition yielded to newfound reason.

Stone by stone the Gek Dominion crumbled.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_27	{The Gek stood in the shadow of the Atlas Interface. It did not open. It did not speak. Yet, the First Spawn felt awe. They felt their insignificance at the centre of an unending universe. It was improbable. Yet within infinity all things remain possible.

The Gek changed. The Diminishment had begun.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_28	{The unspeaking, unmoving Atlas Interface inflicted an insignificance upon the Gek emissaries that showed them their role within the expanse of infinity. It forced recognition of their true place in a limitless universe.

The Gek saw their folly, their heads bowed in shame for the miscalculations they had wrought.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_29	{The Cult of the Atlas took hold as the First Spawn of the Gek crumbled. The Diminishment was at its apex. Endless expansion turned to dust. Eons of aggression receded. The Gek saw new solutions and the Korvax became free.

The miscalculations of the past paved the way for the discovery of a newfound balance.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_30	{The low spawn Gek turned on their leaders. Their First Spawn were cast out, ripped from their spawning pools and cast into the dust. Their lamentations curdled the air.

The wisdom of the Korvax and the Atlas prevailed.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_31	{The Entities of the Korvax are free. Free to study the Atlas. Free to praise the Sentinels. Free to aid the Travellers if probability will allow.

Korvax and Gek would begin anew, equal in standing, united in the eternal search for balance and understanding.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_32	{The coming of the Travellers is possible, as all things are. Yet the chances are infinitesimal. We watch the skies nonetheless. If they do not come here, they will exist elsewhere and our kind – or a kind like us will welcome them.

Within the chaos of the infinite we must cling to the probable.}
EXP_1_PLAQUE_LORE_33	{All things must happen. All things will occur. Somewhere, elsewhere or as a part of the hereafter.

Now ends the testament of the Korvax.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_6	{The Outer Edge BURNS at the hands of the Gek First Spawn. Our enemies are broken. We are the extinguishers of hope.

In our wake we leave only the lamentations of the conquered. We fear NOTHING.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_7	{The MINOR GEK are the inferior breed, lurking in pools, procreating and dying without consequence.

The First Spawn Gek CONQUER WORLDS, each of their spawns is an imprint on the destiny of the galaxy.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_8	{The larval pools of Balaron GAVE GLORIOUS RISE to the FIRST SPAWN. As we SPRANG FORTH the Outer Edge RECOILED in FEAR.

None could oppose our rise. None will bring about our end.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_9	{The First Spawn is the SCOURGE of the OUTER EDGE. In its wake empires will fall. Planets will crumble. Galaxies will kneel. TREMBLE at our name. For we are the ALMIGHTY Gek.

None can oppose our ascendance.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_10	{The First Spawn GREW. WEAKLING PORWIGLE lost their tails to the Spawning Syrup and became MIGHTY warriors.

Each was imbued with the might of the Gek Dominion and its unquenchable will to claim the stars.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_11	{Those born of the Gek who OPPOSED the Dominion were hurled from the spawning pools of the FIRST SPAWN.

Their cherished spawning syrup was replaced with FLAME. Their kind are now merely beasts of the field.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_12	{The MINOR GEK were purged. It is only through fire that imperfection be destroyed and the path to domination is revealed.

The First Spawn feasted on the flesh of the discarded and GREW STRONG.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_13	{After the OPPOSERS were cast from the spawning pools the Sentinels DESCENDED. Their cause was unjust. Aggressors guided to the fray by the scent emissions of a WAR too GREAT and TOO MIGHTY for the automatons to resist.

The First Spawn would remember this.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_14	{The First Spawn BRED and PLOTTED while the Sentinels patrolled the skies of Balaron for a MULTITUDE of CYCLES. But the automaton victories were but illusions.

Beneath watchful metallic eyes Gek legions rose.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_15	{The HOLY larval pools of Balaron SPRANG FORTH with the PUREST of PORWIGLES. Generation BEGAT generation. Wholesome and strong, iron of fist and with a granite resolve.

We, the wise FIRST SPAWN, held back our TIDE of BLOOD. We waited to ATTACK. The unseen blow strikes the hardest.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_16	{The DAWN of the EMPIRE of the FIRST SPAWN was BIRTHED in the SHADOW of the FOLLY of the Great Vy'keen Sentinel War.

The rock and the wave collided as we kept our vigil, awaiting signs of weakness to pave our coming.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_17	{The Vy'keen FOOLISHLY fought a war with no end. Again and again they threw their warriors against the iron tide. The Sentinels SINGED Vy'keen FLESH with LASER. The Vy'keen scorched their foe with righteous fire.

From the SHADOWS the FIRST SPAWN watched and prepared to unleash their reckoning.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_18	{The Vy'keen and Sentinels clashed, SPILLING BLOOD and WHITE METAL through the void, each blow weakening their defences against the fate that awaited them in the shadows.

It would not be long before the First Spawn took their RIGHTFUL place as emperors of the STARS.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_19	{The Vy'keen SPILLED THEIR OWN PUTRID BLOOD and pushed the SENTINEL MACHINES back from the Outer Edge. They drove forward like crashing tides, leaving broken metal in their wake. For a time the Sentinels became SILENT.

In this silence came the GLORIOUS GEK ASCENT. It came with the RIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION of Korvax Prime.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_20	{Korvax Prime was a VAST and PRECIOUS landscape of MINERAL ORE and POWER. By right of UNIVERSAL RULE the First Spawn claimed dominion over the planet yet the CREDULOUS and FEEBLE Korvax refused to accept their CONQUEST.

They DENIED progress. This: their greatest folly.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_21	{Driven by the misguided desire for planetary equilibrium the Korvax REFUSED to delve deep inside their planet and PROFIT from the JEWEL granted them by FATE. Their love for the DIRE WILL of the Sentinels was ABHORRENT to the Gek.

Swift was their end brought about by the First Spawn's STRIKE.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_22	{The destruction of KORVAX PRIME was VAST, SUDDEN and MIGHTY. In a tide of steel the First Spawn struck, scattering the planet through the cosmos as a warning to the unyielding.

The absent Sentinels could not PUNISH the RIGHTFUL ASCENDANCY OF THE GEK.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_23	{The First Spawn FEASTED on the DEBRIS of KORVAX PRIME, gorging on a banquet of fragments plucked from the void, consumed to fuel the Great Ascendency. The universe shook as the Gek grew RICH.

The Korvax found only DESPAIR. The Dominion became whole.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_24	{A FEAR of the FIRST SPAWN spread throughout the Outer Edge. Planets shook. Systems recoiled. Weak alliances formed and were crushed.

ANGUISH CONSUMED WORLDS. They shall fear us FOREVER MORE.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_25	{The entities of the Korvax were NOT destroyed. The First Spawn are BENEVOLENT. The First Spawn are MERCIFUL. SLAVERY SAVED THE WORTHLESS.

They toiled for their conquerors. Their reprieve was found in servitude.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_26	{The Korvax knowledge BECAME OURS. The Korvax technology BECAME OURS. The Korvax BECAME OURS.

They serve as an example of our boundless power and mercy.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_27	{The Korvax did not dare FIGHT. Respect for the Sentinels is KORVAX WEAKNESS. Weakness is the path to defeat.

Today the Korvax fester in ELECTRONIC CHAINS. The Gek look down upon them from their thrones.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_28	{The Gek First Spawn stand on the MIGHTY BRINK of an ETERNAL EMPIRE. It is ENDLESS in TIME. It is ENDLESS in space.

Their dominion will know no bounds. Their armies will know no equal.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_29	{Every Korvax ELECTRONIC REBELLION will be PUT DOWN. Their appeals to their false and non-existent ATLAS are mere SUPERSTITION found through DESPAIR. They are in VAIN. THEY ARE CONQUERED.

The breaking of the uprising shall know NO MERCY. Endless shall be their suffering.}
TRA_1_PLAQUE_LORE_30	{This Galaxy is VAST but it is KNOWABLE and it can be CONQUERED. It shall be subjugated. The rising tide of the First Spawn will sweep away any that oppose it.

These tablets are our testament FOR ALL TIME.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_6	{It came to pass that the Great Monolith awoke. It heard the challenge of Hirk. Five times Hirk called upon it and was met by silence.

On the sixth cry it awoke.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_7	{The Great Monolith spoke to Hirk of the Travellers. Their coming should not be met with fire. Their coming was but one dream in an infinite Universe. Their reach would be that of the endless.

When Hirk asked of the Sentinels, the Great Monolith said nothing. Hirk was troubled by its silence.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_8	{Hirk returned to the Vy'keen. 'Grah!' they spake atop the sacred mountain of Dun's'kaareen. And proclaiming loudly to all who had gathered there, their leader said unto them, 'The Great Monolith has answered me. It has awoken.'

'It has told of the coming of the Travellers. They will be spared. The Vy'keen shall honour this decree.'}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_9	{The crowd cried for Hirk to reveal the Great Monolith's judgement of the Sentinel threat. “The Monolith stood silent!” Hirk spake forth, but the people were not satisfied. They muttered amongst themselves and those blessed with tendrils did extend them.

Then with raised voice Hirk decreed, “The oppressors will be eradicated! Gather your arms for the time of reckoning is upon the enemy.” And the Vy'keen adored their leader.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_10	{As Hirk stood upon the sacred mountain Nal climbed to its peak and there with fist outstretched challenged Hirk. 'Fool!' Nal cried. 'The Sentinels cannot be vanquished!' Hirk, with furious rage struck the fool from the mountain.

For three moons and suns Nal fell before being claimed by doom.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_11	{Hirk's rage against the upstart Nal inflamed the hearts of Nal's followers who upon their leader's demise felt the blood of the ancestors rise within them.

The Vy'keen nations were bathed in righteous war for sixty-six moons.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_12	{On the sixty-sixth moon the war cry of the Vy'keen of Nal was silenced. After surveying their bodies, Hirk gazed unto the heavens and there beheld a great Sentinel host descending upon the Vy'keen.

The great Vy'keen Sentinel War was at hand.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_13	{For a multitude of cycles the yoke of the Sentinels had strangled the civilizations of the galaxy in their mewling cribs.

Hirk was displeased with the world of the Vy'keen. As the automatons descended, Hirk gazed upon a planet ravaged by weakness.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_14	{Progress, prosperity and war: these are the things forbidden by automatons. But the Vy'keen were the first to break the shackles, casting the old ways into the pit to herald the birth of a new age.

The Vy'keen were the dam that overflowed. Righteous is the flood.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_15	{Grah! The Sentinels are the enemy of progress and civilization. They are not of the natural order. Their interference is an affront to the virtuous Vy'keen crusade, which seeks to balance in all things through blood, ashes and iron.

This affront to the Vy'keen and their creed cannot go unpunished.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_16	{Before the coming of Hirk the Vy'keen feared the Sentinels. Like all races our people cowered from their unquestioning violence, shrank from their tyrannical rule. But the coming of Hirk heralded a new dawn.

Through their leader, the Vy'keen became strong. Now their courage knows no bounds.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_17	{Hirk looked to the skies and witnessed the pitiless destruction of the Sentinels that smothered all races brought forth out unto the Outer Edge.

Worlds withered and died beneath their relentless gaze. The anger of Hirk was unleashed.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_18	{And so it came to pass that on the eve of the eighteenth moon of Drun'Gala Hirk cast the shackles of the Sentinel oppressors into the pit.

The Vy'keen were the glorious first, the rising water that broke the dam. The endless war began.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_19	{The death of Hirk came during the endless war. Hirk's body was ravaged by old age, becoming ancient and useless. Bellowing, Hirk tore this failing body in two before the Great Monolith, as is the Vy'keen way.

The echo of that dying roar can still be heard throughout the Outer Edge. Hirk lives in us, the most venerated of the ancients.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_20	{Countless cycles sifted through the claws of time. Attrition was great. The battle against the Sentinels raged endlessly. But through righteous fire the Vy'keen endured and the Sentinels burned.

The oppressors were pushed back. Back into the dark of space.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_21	{The Vy'keen saw borders stretch between the stars. Onwards they delved with legions at their back, scorching Sentinel metal from their fiery chariots and attack ships.

The Vy'keen gazed upon their conquests and saw that they were righteous and good.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_22	{The Vy'keen rose in glorious victory, yet noble warriors grew tired and weak. The onslaught against the machines endured for ninety-nine times ninety cycles. There was attrition and incalculable death, but victory eluded them still.

The endless replication of the Sentinels slowed, but could not be vanquished.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_23	{Grah! The Sentinel hordes were pushed back. The oppressors fled into the sanctuary of the cosmos. The spirit of Hirk surveyed the field of battle, and saw that the Vy'keen victory was glorious and just. The automatons became silent as the nation of Hirk feasted upon grahgrah.

The songs of the victorious echoed to the edges of the galaxy.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_24	{And thus the Sentinel horde congregated in the dark places of the void. There they watched in the in-between nothingness. The blackness of space.

Thy waited beyond the limits of the Outer Edge. As millennia passed they replenished, growing a force to return their order for countless ages.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_25	{The Vy'keen licked each other's wounds during the Silence of the Sentinels, while the dishonourable Gek First Spawn chose to destroy Korvax Prime.

The Vy'keen condemned this crime, but lacked the strength to fight.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_26	{The Gek Empire flourished. It spread its empire into the depths of the cosmos. The Vy'keen victory in pushing the Sentinels back from the Outer Edge gave rise to Dominion of another.

No world, moon, or race could have opposed the Gek onslaught.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_27	{The brutality of the Gek First Spawn called back the automatons that were hiding in the darkness. Their forces had grown. Their technologies had developed.

The foolish Gek beckoned the monster back into the places where our nations might have dwelt in strange harmony. True Sentinel domination of the Outer Edge began.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_28	{Within a single lifetime the Sentinels had returned. They came to dwell on every world we knew. Every world we went on to discover.

The pathetic, idiotic Gek had doomed the Outer Edge to aeons of their rule.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_29	{The dominion of the Gek First Spawn crumbled. They fell apart through idiocy, and through the unchanging will of the beings they enslaved but could never understand.

Their power is but a memory. Their crimes forgotten by so many.}
WAR_1_PLAQUE_LORE_30	{The Gek changed. They became peaceful. Their spawning pools bred in the name of commerce. They Vy'keen accept this peace, but we do not forget as the other beings of the Galaxy are so keen to do.

Dishonour is unchanging. Crimes marked in blood do not fade. We do not forget.}
TRA_MON_DESC_1	{I'm inspecting the monolith's surface when, suddenly, a ragged claw grabs me. Despite being broken and fragmented, it holds me tight while an ancient metallic beak emerges from the living rock. 
 
It shouts in an ancient tongue, unaware of who or what I am.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_1	{Underling! The Gek First Spawn demand help! Give metal!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_1	{Give metal}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_1	{Smash claw}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_1	{Wait}
TRA_MON_RES_A_1	{The metallic hand releases its grip and grabs at my offering.

I have perhaps appeased an ancient evil...}
TRA_MON_RES_B_1	{I smash the metallic claw into pieces.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_1	{The claw grips me tightly. Just when I feel like my forearm will crack into pieces...

...I am released. The pain is agonizing.}
TRA_MON_DESC_2	{I see a strange vision. A small winged creature lands on the very top of the monolith. Suddenly, its eyes glow red and its head revolves in a full circle. It screams for mercy in an ancient voice that wants itself dead.

The poor animal has clearly broken its neck, but the monolith's power of possession still animates it. I wonder if the right thing would be to shoot it, and put it out of its misery.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_2	{Underling! The Gek First Spawn demand you destroy the weak!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_2	{Shoot the creature}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_2	{Leave the creature alone.}
TRA_MON_RES_A_2	{The poor winged creature is no more.

The monolith rewards my actions.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_2	{The possession ends, and the poor winged creature drops down dead.

All else is silent.}
TRA_MON_DESC_3	{A portion of the monolith melts in front of my eyes. The face of a trader emerges, its beak cut off for reasons unknown. It screams and writhes in the bubbling vertical lava, desperately reaching out to me - with a multi-tool in its hand.

Supercooled liquid frenium from my suit systems could relieve its pain, but I can also take a risk and pull it from the molten rock.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_3	{The Gek First Spawn destroy the pirate!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_3	{Cool lava}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_3	{Reach into lava}
TRA_MON_RES_A_3	{The relieved ancient trader pushes a gift out towards me.

The lifeform is absorbed back into the rock.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_3	{I pull the overjoyed trader from the burning lava.

It dematerialises suddenly, leaving only what it carried.}
TRA_MON_DESC_4	{The monolith's glyphs take on a faint yellow tinge, then flicker and disappear. It has no power: the mysterious forces that fuel these stones are weak. I hear a faint crackling whisper on the planetary breeze, and I notice a hole in the monument's base.

I could potentially fit some of my mined resources through the gap...}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_4	{First Spawn... power... low ... give... element... organic... carbon...}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_4	{Insert organic element}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_4	{Insert catalytic element}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_4	{Insert metallic element}
TRA_MON_RES_A_4	{I awake this place's vengeful spirits.

They reward me.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_4	{There is silence.

My elements are not returned.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_4	{There is silence.

My elements are not returned.}
TRA_MON_DESC_5	{The monolith has the smell of burnt metal and heavy industry. Strange runes swirl and transform, forcing an image deep into my mind.

I look into the past. I see a small beaked figure, silhouetted by the light of a forge, industriously hammering armour. Next to it, a cloaked companion idly watches – seemingly content to avoid the work. Both look at me. I must choose.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_5	{The First Spawn gives help to the worker. The First Spawn destroy the workshy.}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_5	{Choose the worker}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_5	{Choose the onlooker}
TRA_MON_RES_A_5	{I have pleased this place's spirits.

My equipment is filled with a strange power.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_5	{I have angered this place's spirits.

My equipment is damaged by a strange force.}
TRA_MON_DESC_6	{The ground in front of the monolith is indented by the knees of a thousand ancient pilgrims who once knelt here. A stone block, slowly, pulls back in front of me. Inside the hollow recess I'm surprised to see canisters of luxury products that have built up there through the ages...

I feel greedy unknown forces watching my every move.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_6	{Goods for the First Spawn! Goods for the ancient terror of the galaxy!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_6	{Give trade goods}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_6	{Take trade goods}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_6	{Give nothing}
TRA_MON_RES_A_6	{The undiluted joy of a forgotten tribe spills from the monolith.

I am healed, blessed and rewarded.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_6	{I retrieve several canisters.

A feeble howl of pain and dismay whispers around me.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_6	{A feeble howl of pain and dismay whispers around me.}
TRA_MON_DESC_7	{I am not alone. Tiny beaked creatures gambol around my feet. To them I am a giant, and they recoil in terror when they see me towering above them. The air fills with an unpleasant aroma, as they pin themselves against the hard edifice of the unforgiving monolith.

The terrifying obelisk itself sits in judgement above us all – both myself and the creatures of the vision.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_7	{Destroy the impure. Destroy the low.}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_7	{Pet the creatures}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_7	{Further terrify the creatures}
TRA_MON_RES_A_7	{Before they disappear into the ether, the creatures thank me.

The spirits that haunt this place, however, are displeased.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_7	{The spirits that haunt this place are greatly amused.

When the quaking beaked creatures disappear, they are replaced by a gift...}
TRA_MON_DESC_8	{A terrible thirst overwhelms me, but my hydration systems are suddenly inoperable. My throat is dry, and I feel dazed. Two ancient stone cups appear.

The first is vibrant red chalice full of a slick bubbly transparent liquid. The other is embossed with the shape of a circular red shield, and has a faint yellow tone. Neither look appetizing, but if I don't take in water my death feels certain. My hand wavers between the two.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_8	{Underling! Drink the healing spittle or drink the recharging spawning syrup of the First Spawn! Choose or die!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_8	{Drink the transparent liquid}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_8	{Drink the yellow liquid}
TRA_MON_RES_A_8	{I gag slightly as the liquid treacles through my hydration systems.

Suddenly, my body feels renewed.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_8	{The bitter taste of the liquid washes through my hydration systems.

Suddenly, all my systems are stored and repaired.}
TRA_MON_DESC_9	{An unseen replication of my own self and exosuit stalks around the edge of the monolith. It screams in an ancient tongue while forcing me down onto my knees.

The doppelganger first places its boltcaster to my forehead, and then mimes cutting my belly open with the mining beam. It smiles pleasantly. I am to choose my desired execution.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_9	{Choose your death! First Spawn favour obedient ToilGek underling!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_9	{A bolt to the brain}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_9	{A laser beam to the torso}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_9	{Fight back}
TRA_MON_RES_A_9	{I close my eyes and await death. It does not come.

The doppelganger leaves me a multi-tool technology blueprint.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_9	{I close my eyes and wait to be scythed open. The pain never comes.

The doppelganger leaves me an exosuit technology blueprint.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_9	{My flailing attack is blocked by a shove of my twin's multi-tool.

The doppelganger laughs before disappearing.}
TRA_MON_DESC_10	{A barely visible crack down the centre of the ancient edifice spits out dust. The monolith shakes, and two vast doors swing open. The interior of the ancient structure is hollow, and has been used as a burial chamber.

An ancient beaked lifeform with bulging eyes lies desiccated atop an unlit funeral pyre. At its feet lie ancient treasures and technologies that have been left with it for its next life... wherever that might be
.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_10	{Burn almighty First Spawn obedient ToilGek! Respect First Spawn belongings!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_10	{Light pyre with Mining Beam}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_10	{Take tomb treasures}
TRA_MON_RES_A_10	{As it burns the corpse awakes. It nods to me, howling in pleasure.

It leaves me its tribute.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_10	{I snatch away some of the corpse's tribute.

The doors slam shut, but an ancient curse hangs heavy around me.}
TRA_MON_DESC_11	{The Monolith stands forlorn and seemingly forgotten. If I strain, I can see faint marks in the ground where ancient tribes would once come to worship and commune with the edifice. A gust of alien breeze carries a faint whisper of a voice. I struggle to hear it.

Again, the voice echoes around me. Stronger this time. I try to make out the words desperately crying out for my attention.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_11	{Friend... worship us... kneel before the Gek First Spawn in silence...}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_11	{Kneel}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_11	{Try to communicate}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_11	{Turn away}
TRA_MON_RES_A_11	{The spirits that have combined with this strange monument bless my journey.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_11	{There is no answer to my call. I talk only to the wind.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_11	{The spirits that are melded with strange monument remain silent.}
TRA_MON_DESC_12	{A beak emerges from the ancient stone. It's shouting, but can't be heard. In the stone above someone, long ago, has scrawled advice for those who would approach it.
 
The beak screams wordlessly at me, furiously intoning the words of the ancient beings that once worshipped here. My scanner detects traces of a catalyst around it, but can't specify which one.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_12	{Feed First Spawn beak common catalyst! Metal brings painful noise! Furious noise!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_12	{Feed beak common catalyst}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_12	{Feed beak uncommon catalyst}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_12	{Feed beak metal}
TRA_MON_RES_A_12	{The beak whispers the words of those who once worshipped here.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_12	{The beak shouts the words of those who once worshipped here.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_12	{The beak screams the words of those who once worshipped here.

The noise is extreme. I feel great pain.}
TRA_MON_DESC_13	{I see a strange vision. Time is reverted. I am sat on a platform looking down on an execution. Two small beaked traders are kneeling before me. One is small and wiry, the other is obese with jowls that brush the wooden stage. Another lifeform, who wears a green cloth mask, readies an axe behind them.

The traders beg me for mercy. The familiar dry, croaky voice of an ancient tribe whispers encouragement into my ear...}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_13	{First Spawn friend receive belongings of the executed. Murder fat trader, or murder rich miner?}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_13	{Execute fat lifeform}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_13	{Execute thin lifeform}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_13	{Show mercy}
TRA_MON_RES_A_13	{The fat lifeform is finally beheaded after three strikes of the axe.

I receive its worldly goods.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_13	{The thin lifeform is finally beheaded after a single of the axe.

I receive all the money it owns.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_13	{In this timeline at least, the two lifeforms are saved. They weep and thank me.

The spirits of the monolith are displeased.}
TRA_MON_DESC_14	{A strange new reality grips me. The ancient structure swings open to reveal a body encased in ice. It is a patchwork of different body parts. Its ragged beak appears to have been stitched on with animal gut.

A hand-written sign in the language of the ancient traders can be seen above the body's head. Some sort of fuel would most likely melt the ice...}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_14	{Beware! Murderous abomination! Do not awake! Terror! Despair!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_14	{Melt ice}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_14	{ออก}
TRA_MON_RES_A_14	{The creature's eyes flick open. Its hands leap around my throat.

I force it back into the depths of the disapproving Monolith.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_14	{The panel on the Monolith swings shut.

The abomination remains trapped. I am thanked.}
TRA_MON_DESC_15	{I am an observer. I witness beaked traders dressed in modern exosuits leaving an object at the base of a Monolith. It is a small mesh of wires and canisters. They charge it with a strange metal, then quickly depart.

As if in a dream, I approach the ancient edifice. It all suddenly feels real. I live and breathe in the recent past.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_15	{Stop the destruction! Save the Monolith! Protect the First Spawn!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_15	{Leave object alone}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_15	{Remove chromatic metal}
TRA_MON_RES_A_15	{The device explodes. Reality is restored.

The Monolith was not destroyed, but the spirits that haunt this place are angered.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_15	{The device is made safe. It was due to explode.

Reality is restored. I am thanked.}
TRA_MON_DESC_16	{Reality changes. I'm standing in a crater beneath a jet black sky. I'm up to my knees in a strange syrup that glows pink in the darkness. Spherical eggs float around me. Some of these mucus-covered orbs smell terrible, others are sweet and delicate.

The taint of the foul eggs is infecting the entirety of the spawning pool. I am filled by an urge to separate them.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_16	{Retain foul First Spawn stench! Remove sweet eggs from the spawning syrup!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_16	{Remove noxious eggs from pool}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_16	{Remove sweet-smelling eggs from pool}
TRA_MON_RES_A_16	{I have angered the ancients Gek spirits that dwell here.

Reality is restored.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_16	{I am smiled upon by vengeful ancient spirits.

Reality is restored.}
TRA_MON_DESC_17	{I am being watched. I look above, and see a giant lidless eye hovering over the monolith. It stares down at me unblinkingly. It does not move. It does not look elsewhere.

Its gaze is remorseless. It feels like it has always been there. Its centre crackles with a bright technological blue...}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_17	{The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair! The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair! The First Spawn watches you underling. Cower and despair!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_17	{Cower}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_17	{Stare back}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_17	{Shoot eye}
TRA_MON_RES_A_17	{The satisfied eye fades away.

It benevolently leaves a gift.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_17	{The eye fades away at my challenge.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_17	{The eye falls to the planet's surface, and is absorbed into the ground.

It leaves behind me a precious reward...}
TRA_MON_DESC_18	{I hear a low rumble, which gradually builds into an ancient scream. It's like no other noise I've ever experienced. To this strange alien landscape it's a calm silence, inside my helmet it's a nightmarish cacophony of pain and death.

Through the noise, however, I can make out some words within the screams.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_18	{ToilGek dare approach First Spawn holy site? Leave! Leave! Depart or die!}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_18	{Touch Monolith}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_18	{Move away}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_18	{Wait}
TRA_MON_RES_A_18	{The vengeful spirits that inhabit this place are grateful for my obedience.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_18	{The vengeful sprits that inhabit this place punish my disobedience.}
TRA_MON_DESC_19	{My reality inverts. I am chained on the monolith, my arms are in manacles above my head and my feet are dangling several feet from the ground. A creature, its beak showing through the blackened animal hide mask, approaches on stilts. It wields a red hot metal rod.

It pecks at my eyes, then pecks at my tongue. I must choose my punishment.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_19	{Advancement through pain! Eyes for knowledge. Tongue for language.}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_19	{Choose eyes}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_19	{Choose tongue}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_19	{Beg for mercy}
TRA_MON_RES_A_19	{The creature plunges its poker into my right eye. This reality fades.

I am left with knowledge.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_19	{The creature plunges its poker into my mouth. The vision fades.

I am gifted the knowledge of an alien language.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_19	{The creature disappears and reality reverts.

The metal rod remains...}
TRA_MON_DESC_20	{A small green hand reaches out through the stone monolith, its fingernails yellowed and dirty. It opens to show an empty palm, and waits for my response.

This feels like part of an ancient tradition. There is no malice, just cold expectation.}
DNT_TRA_MON_LANG_20	{First Spawn demand tax. Pay units immediately.}
TRA_MON_OPT_A_20	{Give element}
TRA_MON_OPT_B_20	{Give units}
TRA_MON_OPT_C_20	{Refuse}
TRA_MON_RES_A_20	{The collector refuses my offering. It curses me.}
TRA_MON_RES_B_20	{The collector takes my offering. The spirits that dwell here are appeased.}
TRA_MON_RES_C_20	{The collector is offended. I am cursed.}
EXP_MON_DESC_1	{I feel faint, as if my mind is being invaded. Pustules on my skin grow, bubble and pop - and I feel countless tiny stabbing pin-pricks scrabbling from each gaping hole.
 
Suddenly metal spiders, perhaps tiny Sentinels, run up my shoulder and into my visor. Can this be real? This CANNOT be real. I start to scream.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_1	{Calm, child.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_1	{Wait it out}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_1	{Fire weapon}
EXP_MON_OPT_C_1	{Remove helmet and scrape away tiny metal spiders}
EXP_MON_RES_A_1	{The hallucination fades. I have passed some sort of test.

A reward materialises.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_1	{The hold on my mind is shattered when I strike the monolith.

Reality is restored.}
EXP_MON_RES_C_1	{The metal spiders enter my skull, and I foolishly rip off my helmet.

The hallucination fades. The pain does not.}
EXP_MON_DESC_2	{Tiny floating tetrahedrons emerge from the planet's surface and surround me. I try to wave them away with my multi-tool, but each time they swarm closer to it - as if attracted to it somehow.

I raise my multi-tool, and they shimmer blue as they dart this way and that. Closer and closer. They are within touching distance of my multitool. They make one final surge...}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_2	{Korvax Echoes will advance the Traveller. Korvax Echoes will advance Traveller's technology.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_2	{Let the tetrahedrons in}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_2	{Escape the tetrahedron cloud}
EXP_MON_RES_A_2	{My multi-tool glows bright blue.

I have a new technology blueprint.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_2	{The sharp edges of the floating objects rip holes in my exosuit.

I gasp for air while it repairs.}
EXP_MON_DESC_3	{I begin to feel dizzy. A strange lethargy comes over me, and I feel compelled to lie down in front of the ancient relic. This place feels calming. It feels like home, wherever that might have once been.

I know that if I truly wanted to fight the impulse to sleep I probably could, but I feel warm and comfortable basking in the glow of the ancient runes.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_3	{Sleep, child. Korvax Echoes bless you.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_3	{Sleep}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_3	{Resist}
EXP_MON_RES_A_3	{I sleep deeply.

I awake reinvigorated.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_3	{I resist the command of the monolith.

Its power fades.}
EXP_MON_DESC_4	{A flickering reflection of my own body emerges from a portal. It mimics every move I make. When I wave, it waves. When I raise my multi-tool, it copies instantly. The doppelganger makes a motion to suggest it wants something, and we both recoil when I realise I've instinctively matched its movements.

Its body shimmers, but its equipment looks somehow real. Its multi-tool looks better than my own. The dimensional irregularity is fading.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_4	{Korvax Echoes command: reward yourself.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_4	{Give multi-tool}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_4	{Give Propulsion Gel}
EXP_MON_OPT_C_4	{Shoot doppelganger}
EXP_MON_RES_A_4	{We hand each other our multi-tools before the doppelganger disappears.

The mirror-me fades, but the gift can remain.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_4	{We hand each other propulsion gel before the doppelganger disappears.

The mirror-me fades, but both gifts remain.}
EXP_MON_RES_C_4	{I see my own look of fear in the doppelganger as I pull the trigger.

I blast myself in the chest.}
EXP_MON_DESC_5	{For many ages it appears that pilgrims have carved numerical figures between the glowing glyphs of the monolith. Looking down, I notice an ancient coin. I scrape the ground with my boot, and unearth several more.

The site is otherwise silent. Perhaps it's eternally unresponsive, or perhaps it waits for something.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_5	{Reject greed. Embrace Atlas.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_5	{Offer units}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_5	{Take coins}
EXP_MON_RES_A_5	{The echoes that dwell here awake.

They thank and bless me.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_5	{The echoes that dwell here awake.

They are disappointed.}
EXP_MON_DESC_6	{I stand next to the powerful glow of the monolith, studying ancient runes, when suddenly my multi-tool begins to heat up. I can see wisps of a strange blue energy being pulled in from the obelisk and surrounding my combat attachments.

If I pull the trigger, the exhaust will automatically open - allowing this strange ethereal substance into the body of my equipment.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_6	{Korvax Echoes bless technology. Allow entrance.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_6	{Pull the trigger}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_6	{Dismiss the attentions of the monolith}
EXP_MON_RES_A_6	{The blue energy field fills my multi-tool.

It somehow installs a new technology blueprint.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_6	{The blue energy slowly dissipates.

I feel alone once more.}
EXP_MON_DESC_7	{I'm running my fingers over the ancient glowing runes, when I look down. An expanding pool of liquid metal has rippled out of the obelisk's base. My feet have already been covered. In the bright reflection I see my expression turn to horror as I begin to sink.

I feel warming hands on my legs, pulling me down into the silver sheet. Every hazard detection device on my multi-tool is going haywire. Radiation, heat, cold... every danger imaginable.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_7	{Bathe in our waters. Feel Korvax Echoes calm.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_7	{Sink}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_7	{Struggle}
EXP_MON_RES_A_7	{I emerge from the metal pool in a fetal position. I feel alive and reinvigorated.

Some equipment is repaired and recharged.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_7	{I thrash from side to side in the metal pool.

I am free, but the hazards have taken their toll.}
EXP_MON_DESC_8	{I see a strange vision. Blue light pours from the monolith as if a curtain has been dropped within. I hear a gentle hubbub of voices, and catch a familiar smell on the breeze. I cannot remember my home, but I know that this doorway leads there.

I ache for a past I cannot remember. Every inch of my soul wants to make the leap back. I look to the skies, and the infinity beyond. Can I truly abandon my journey, when it's only just begun?}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_8	{Past is dead. Reconstruction impossible.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_8	{Step back into the past}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_8	{Resist temptation}
EXP_MON_RES_A_8	{The portal slips shut as soon as I make a move.

I feel the pity of the spirits that live in this place.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_8	{I try to capture a memory of these sensations, before turning away.

The spirits that dwell here admire my decision. I am rewarded.}
EXP_MON_DESC_9	{Two stone blocks slowly revolve on the base of the monolith. Two beads of red light then trace images on each one. The red lights then pool together and liquefy in an indentation below. The closer I get, the more agitated the red pool becomes.

The images both show masked electronic lifeforms. The first shows the lifeform absorbing power to break free from its shackles. The second shows it hiding from its captors.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_9	{Korvax Entities escaped slavery. Korvax Echoes share this knowledge.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_9	{Place hand on the lifeform breaking free}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_9	{Place hand on the lifeform taking shelter}
EXP_MON_RES_A_9	{The red liquid surges into my multi-tool.

It somehow unlocks a technology blueprint.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_9	{The red liquid surges into my exosuit.

It somehow unlocks a technology blueprint.}
EXP_MON_DESC_10	{A chiselled hole appears at the foot of the obelisk. From its smoothed edges and the scraped markings around it, it's clear that over centuries unknown creatures have pushed elements through this gap.

It's impossible to tell quite what will happen, but below it are three blocks of the exact same dimensions that look like they can be turned by a mechanism deep within the monolith itself. I search my gear for the rare elements that look like they could fit...}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_10	{Korvax Echoes embrace Traveller gift.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_10	{Insert organic element}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_10	{Insert rare metal}
EXP_MON_OPT_C_10	{Insert rare catalyst}
EXP_MON_RES_A_10	{The monolith somehow transforms my offering.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_10	{The monolith somehow increases my offering.}
EXP_MON_RES_C_10	{The monolith somehow increases my offering.}
EXP_MON_DESC_11	{The Monolith disappears. The landscape around me seems the same, but somehow the planetary vegetation has moved. Sitting central to where the mysterious stone once stood is a red glowing orb.

The intensity of the orb burns the ground beneath it. It crackles with an unknown power. I feel compelled to pick it up, and become a part of it. A distant voice speaks to me...}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_11	{Behold the holy Atlas stone. Avoid contact. Show respect.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_11	{Hold red orb}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_11	{Stand back}
EXP_MON_RES_A_11	{The red orb scorches my skin.

I am torn back to my own reality.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_11	{The red orb convulses, hovers up and plunges into my chest.

I am blessed and rejuvenated. Reality is restored.}
EXP_MON_DESC_12	{I'm trying to read the ancient glyphs when a liquid metal lasso emerges and wraps itself around my helmet. It freezes in place, before pulling my head into contact with the glow of the monolith.

The ancient stone is warm, and deep inside I hear the hum of an arcane technology as it prepares to unleash itself. I look up back up to the glyphs to try to guess why this might be happening. They talk to me in an alien tongue.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_12	{Korvax Echoes bless with language. Do not resist.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_12	{Pull free}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_12	{Wait}
EXP_MON_RES_A_12	{An entire language floods every part of my mind.

I retain what I can. The rest fades almost instantaneously.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_12	{I wrench myself free. The strange metal connector sparks and hisses.

I retain the rare elements it was made from...}
EXP_MON_DESC_13	{A child emerges from the monolith. It takes a few moments before I realise that... it's me. I look carefree and innocent. The little one stares up at my exosuit, and tries to see me through my visor.

The child suddenly starts to weep, and clings to my knees. It implores me never to leave. It doesn't want to be alone. I should stay here forever. We should be reunited. Whole again once more.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_13	{Past is dead. Youth is over. Only the traveller journey remains.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_13	{Stay}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_13	{Comfort, then leave}
EXP_MON_OPT_C_13	{ออก}
EXP_MON_RES_A_13	{The child withdraws and shakes its head.

I try to embrace it. It turns to dust.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_13	{The child understands. We embrace.

It leaves me with a gift.}
EXP_MON_RES_C_13	{The child wails. It can't understand my decision.

The monolith looks down upon us in silent judgement.}
EXP_MON_DESC_14	{An empty shell of an electronic lifeform emerges from the monolith. It is ancient and weather-beaten. The light in its mask has been extinguished for many centuries.

It holds a rusted canister in its hand, and my scanner detects that it once held refined metal. The scan also reveals an unknown substance deep within the defunct entity's casing.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_14	{Korvax Echoes request! Traveller! Restore holy casing to Korvax Convergence! Ignore valuable casing! Please!}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_14	{Add metal to canister}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_14	{Open casing}
EXP_MON_RES_A_14	{The lights in the mask flicker on. The casing convulses before being absorbed back into the monolith.

I am blessed.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_14	{I crack open the metal casing and retrieve a valuable reward.

A strange feeling of coldness and desolation comes over me as I do so...}
EXP_MON_DESC_15	{The land around me suddenly inverts. My reality is flipped. The inside of the planet is hollow, and I'm standing at the base of its vast bowl. Around me the roots of trees push upwards from uncovered alien soil.

I look down, and see the foundations of the Monolith raised at my feet. Crystalline veins of different elements pulsate through the exposed rock. I hear a lifeform screaming in binary.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_15	{Overpowered Korvax Echoes subvert reality. Restore order. Remove power. Remove organic corruption.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_15	{Extract organic elements}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_15	{Extract metal}
EXP_MON_OPT_C_15	{Extract rare metal}
EXP_MON_RES_A_15	{Reality is restored. Inversion ends.

I am thanked.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_15	{The inversion gets worse. I feel as if every part of me is fed through itself.

I emerge alive, but broken.}
EXP_MON_DESC_16	{My movements seem normal, but everything else is running faster than it should. The sun spins around this globe in seconds, days endlessly turn to night and back again. The creatures that graze and hunt around site pass by in a blur.

I'm trapped in a time vortex. Numbers on my multi-tool seem to tick higher and higher. The closer I get to the Monolith, the more disturbance is added to the timeline...}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_16	{Traveller! Move back to join future. Touch monolith to restore timeline.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_16	{Touch monolith}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_16	{Move away}
EXP_MON_RES_A_16	{The timeline is reverted and restored.

Nothing has changed.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_16	{I step out into the future.

My experience is unchanged, but galactic interest rates have had an effect on my unit count.}
EXP_MON_DESC_17	{I am being watched. A red laser dot appears on the ancient stone structure. I'm a target. I turn, but can't see the potential assailant. Somewhere out there on the alien landscape, someone's about to pull a trigger.

There's no cover to speak of, and no time to get behind the obelisk. Suddenly, the words of an unknown power blaze brightly on the monolith.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_17	{Traveller, retreat! Korvax Echoes give protection. Move back.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_17	{Touch monolith}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_17	{Move back}
EXP_MON_OPT_C_17	{Stand still}
EXP_MON_RES_A_17	{The monolith does nothing. A distant crack of a long-range boltcaster wounds me.

Beyond that, silence.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_17	{I quickly move back, allowing a bright red energy surge to build in the Monolith.

It targets a distant figure, who is swiftly vaporised.}
EXP_MON_DESC_18	{Stars have aligned above the monolith. In the heavens above two distinct lines of distant suns can be seen stretching out into the depths of space. To be here at this exact moment in time, when the moving parts of the galaxy are aligned so perfectly, would seem almost an impossibility.

I am filled with a strange calm. One line of stars points towards the glow of a dull red giant, the other an unseen point far, far beyond my vision.}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_18	{Traveller. Embrace unknown. Shine light in darkness. Discover galaxy centre.}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_18	{Choose red giant}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_18	{Choose unseen point}
EXP_MON_RES_A_18	{The stars seem to move out of alignment.

I am unrewarded, and alone.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_18	{I am blessed with a gift that will aid my journey to this distant, unknown location.}
EXP_MON_DESC_19	{I feel faint. Ill, even. Looking around, the vegetation that surrounds this ancient structure looks withered and sickly. The creatures of the planet, meanwhile, appear to keep their distance. Environmental warning sensors in my exosuit are behaving erratically.

I could tie some of my Protection Mesh's operations to this place, but it's unclear exactly what. The answer perhaps lies in a warning that's been etched into the stone...}
DNT_EXP_MON_LANG_19	{Beware! Monolith create dangerous toxins! Poison! Move back!}
EXP_MON_OPT_A_19	{Reduce monolith's toxicity}
EXP_MON_OPT_B_19	{Dampen monolith's radiation}
EXP_MON_RES_A_19	{The toxins released by the monolith are temporarily contained.

I am thanked by the planetary overseer.}
EXP_MON_RES_B_19	{The monolith continues to poison the land around it, and myself.}
WAR_MON_DESC_1	{I am trying to read the glyphs on the ancient monument when I feel a strange chill. A layer of frozen gas suddenly coats the monolith from bottom to top. It's so cold that I can see my breath inside my helmet.

There is one small gap in the crystal ice, and I feel convinced that I could feed some of my mined elements through it, so they can come into contact with the monolith behind.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_1	{Fuel given. Ice thaws. Vy'keen rise.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_1	{Insert organic element}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_1	{Insert catalytic element}
WAR_MON_OPT_C_1	{Insert metallic element}
WAR_MON_RES_A_1	{The frozen gas melts into the atmosphere.

I am rewarded.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_1	{There is silence.

My elements are not returned.}
WAR_MON_RES_C_1	{There is silence.

My elements are not returned.}
WAR_MON_DESC_2	{The body of a warrior emerges from the obelisk, a jagged tear in their midriff suggesting that the dangerous-looking multi-tool that sits in their hand was not enough to save them.
 
The surface of the sculpted rock blurs and shows images of military worship. It's trying to tell me something.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_2	{Respect the Warrior! Respect their weapon!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_2	{Bury the soldier and multi-tool}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_2	{Take the multi-tool and leave}
WAR_MON_RES_A_2	{Ancient voices howl their appreciation in a wind that whips around me.

An offering emerges from the monolith.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_2	{I take the multi-tool from the body.
 
I'm about to turn to leave when a crimson bolt of energy strikes me on the right shoulder.}
WAR_MON_DESC_3	{I see a strange vision. A small terrified creature emerges from the monolith and runs between my legs. I hear the noises of an ancient hunt: the howls of pack animals in pursuit and the thunder of hooves. 

Warriors on vast beasts charge through the rock, and amidst the chaos one sees me staring. It raises its facial tendrils in greeting, barks a few words and swings a bladed weapon down towards me.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_3	{Grah! Vy'keen Ancients bless your journey!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_3	{Grab weapon}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_3	{Dodge weapon}
WAR_MON_RES_A_3	{The hallucination fades, but the blade remains.

It transforms into a multi-tool I can use.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_3	{I dodge the warrior's attack.

The hunt disappears, and I am left alone.}
WAR_MON_DESC_4	{The monolith shows images of creatures lying dead before it. Each sacrificed, butchered and offered up to whatever Gods were once worshipped here.

Suddenly, the head of a small woodland animal raises up through the earth below me. It stares at me with wide-eyes, then gives a joyful skip when its tiny hooves reach ground level. Something is clearly expected of me...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_4	{The command of the Vy'keen Ancients! Sacrifice the beast! Blood for Hirk!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_4	{Sacrifice the creature}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_4	{Let the creature live}
WAR_MON_RES_A_4	{I blast the woodland animal in two.

I am rewarded for this offering.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_4	{The creature skips around my feet with joyful abandon.

It runs away and out of sight.}
WAR_MON_DESC_5	{Two ancient stone cups materialise in front of the monolith. One is filled with a dark red viscous liquid, the other contains a sticky fluid that is bright yellow and smells powerfully bitter.

On the stone tablet behind the cups ancient glyphs swirl to form an image. A powerful and muscular warrior surrounded by a red halo challenges an opponent clad in bright yellow armour.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_5	{Choose healing blood or renergising bile of the Vy'keen Ancients. Drink destiny.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_5	{Drink the viscous red liquid}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_5	{Drink the bitter yellow liquid}
WAR_MON_RES_A_5	{The liquid seems to clot as I swallow it.

I feel somehow reinvigorated.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_5	{The liquid tastes foul as it washes down my throat.

Suddenly an unknown power repairs all my equipment.}
WAR_MON_DESC_6	{The monolith rips like paper, opening a window to another world. It is laced with a giant web. Just within my reach, an ancient warrior lies cocooned. It has been there for centuries. Dead, vacant eyes stare through me and on into the landscape beyond.

It carries a rusted multi-tool, while a bulging webbed sack on its chest suggests it might carry greater riches on its body. Suddenly, the strange leathery growth starts to move...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_6	{Pathetic dead coward lies here! Interloper! Take your remuneration...}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_6	{Take multi-tool}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_6	{Search body}
WAR_MON_RES_A_6	{The multi-tool is not operational.

I salvage a new technology blueprint.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_6	{Hundreds of arachnids burst from the warrior's corpse.

Their bites are poison, but my search is rewarded.}
WAR_MON_DESC_7	{A portal opens on the monolith, and the body of a huge winged animal falls to my feet. Its throat has been ritually cut, and its wings have been tattooed with faces of an ancient warrior tribe. The eyes though, the eyes look strange...

Its original eyes have been cut out, and replaced by glittering red orbs. The more I look, the more they blaze. An advanced technology clearly lies at their centre. Can I bear to desecrate this sacrifice for help with my journey?}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_7	{Respect the Vy'keen Ancients sacrifice. The beast has holy sight.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_7	{Remove sacrifice's eyes}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_7	{Respect sacrifice}
WAR_MON_RES_A_7	{The red orbs glow, then crackle information through my multi-tool.

I gain a blueprint, but have angered an unknown power.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_7	{The ancients that dwell here smile on my decision.

I am blessed.}
WAR_MON_DESC_8	{The giant mouth of an ancient hound suddenly emerges through the face of the monolith. It opens its jaws wide, and foul-smelling spittle streaks my visor. My nausea is tempered by the sight of valuable commodities balanced on its giant tongue.

In a sudden movement the hound shifts the goods to one side of its mouth, spraying saliva over my arms. There's space on the tongue for more, should I wish to give up some of my cargo...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_8	{Feed the beast}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_8	{Place goods on giant hound tongue}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_8	{Remove goods from giant hound tongue}
WAR_MON_RES_A_8	{The hound swallows my offerings, and licks me enthusiastically.

I am blessed by an ancient power.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_8	{The giant beast clamps its jaws, puncturing my arm with a yellowed canine.

I retrieve the offering.}
WAR_MON_DESC_9	{An ancient warrior's feet and legs slowly emerge from the bottom of the monolith. The rest of its torso then follows, unceremoniously pushed out onto the alien turf. It has been decapitated.

Blood drips at my feet and high above me a disembodied head laughs at my shock. It shouts a guttural command of encouragement down to me. Behind, I hear an ancient blade unsheathe, and someone rushing towards me...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_9	{Brave interloper! Resist fear!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_9	{Stand}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_9	{Kneel}
WAR_MON_RES_A_9	{A spectral blade passes through my neck. I pass the test.

The blood that drips from the warrior's exposed neck turns into a reward.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_9	{A spectral blade passes over my head. The disembodied skull seems disappointed.

I have perhaps failed some sort of test.}
WAR_MON_DESC_10	{The monolith fragments before my eyes. It folds down in on itself, again and again, until it is a tiny red orb surrounded by dancing lights. It feels like something truly ancient, perhaps something divine, is showing me the origin of these strange constructions.

The metal I carry is physically dragging me towards it - desperate to help it rebuild. It's not so much that I'm a pilgrim bearing offerings in hope of a blessing, but more that the elements I carry want to offer themselves...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_10	{The Vy'keen feed the Atlas stone rare metal. It builds. It towers.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_10	{Give common metal}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_10	{Give uncommon metal}
WAR_MON_OPT_C_10	{Give rare metal}
WAR_MON_RES_A_10	{I see my insignificance within the infinite bounds of space.

The monolith slowly rebuilds inch by inch. I am pitied.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_10	{I see my true place within the infinite depth of space and time.

The monolith slowly rebuilds. It pities me.}
WAR_MON_RES_C_10	{I see my true place within the infinite depth of space and time.

The monolith rebuilds, and rewards me in consolation.}
WAR_MON_DESC_11	{I place my palm on the monolith, then stand back when it melts in response to my touch. Molten rock drips down the stone, exposing a hollow interior. Inside, I see riches that are beyond belief. Ancient technologies and cargo that would aid my journey.

Lava continues to drop, and the edifice seems unstable, but equipment that could aid me is within arm's reach. Suddenly, the voice of an ancient tribe shakes the ground I stand on...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_11	{The Vy'keen Ancients burn thieves and pirates.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_11	{Reach in}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_11	{Stand back}
WAR_MON_RES_A_11	{The molten monolith collapses onto my exosuit.

The edifice is reconstructed – the damage remains.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_11	{The ancient warriors who once worshipped here bless my show of respect.}
WAR_MON_DESC_12	{There are three vast columns of words on the ancient structure, each written in a different alphabet. The first column's words are like savage runes scratched in sand, the second shows precise sequences of dots. The final column has wide and welcoming letters, almost appearing hand-written in hard stone.

The dirt and blood of ancient hand prints cover the base of each column.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_12	{Grah! Learn language of the conquerors! Learn language of the conquered!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_12	{Press hand against runes}

WAR_MON_RES_C_12	{The ancient spirits that dwell here infuse me with the language of a distant race of beaked traders.}
WAR_MON_DESC_13	{I become a part of a strange new reality. The ancient rock opens. Inside, the dried out heart of an ancient warrior is strung up between wooden pillars. It pulses slowly as it hangs there, still beating.

Lying below it on a dusty floor are a set of wrinkled lungs that look forever doomed to wheeze stale air. A desiccated eyeball stares up at me. Unblinking.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_13	{Rebuild the ancient warrior body. Restore monolith power.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_13	{Shoot heart}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_13	{Place lungs with heart}
WAR_MON_OPT_C_13	{Respectfully depart}
WAR_MON_RES_A_13	{I hear an ancient scream.

The monolith's power fades.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_13	{The heart and lungs pulse in harmony.

The monolith's power is restored.}
WAR_MON_RES_C_13	{The monolith closes.

I hear disappointed wails from inside.}
WAR_MON_DESC_14	{I live within a new reality. I am inside a vast coliseum and beneath a blood red sky. The noise is overpowering. Warriors scream and bark at the battle set up before them.

Two combatants are squaring up on the crimson sand. One has lost its blade, and hides behind a shield. The other stalks towards it, with a spear raised. I feel compelled to add my voice to the howl of the mob.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_14	{Choose your warrior! Vy'keen ancients reward interloper howl!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_14	{Support endangered gladiator}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_14	{Support spear-wielding gladiator}
WAR_MON_RES_A_14	{The gladiator decapitates its foe with the sharpened shield. It bows towards me.

I am thanked with something to defend me.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_14	{The gladiator plunges the spear straight through its rival's head. It bows towards me.

I am thanked with something to help me destroy my enemies.}
WAR_MON_DESC_15	{I place my hand on the ancient structure and feel an intense heat burning within. Suddenly, as if attracted to my suit, a liquid metal starts to seep from a hole that's been broken into the rock.

What starts as a drip, becomes a surge forcing itself through the gap. The monolith's previous contents are draining, and its glow is starting to fade. A voice screams out.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_15	{Seal gap! Protect Monolith! Precious valuable material lost! Use metal!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_15	{Plug hole with metal}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_15	{Plug hole with catalyst}
WAR_MON_OPT_C_15	{Take molten substance}
WAR_MON_RES_A_15	{The hole is sealed. The monolith's contents are secured.

I am safe, and thanked.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_15	{The catalyst reacts with the molten material. It vaporises, both within the structure and without.

The monolith's power fades.}
WAR_MON_RES_C_15	{The molten material burns my suit.

Its value makes the pain worthwhile.}
WAR_MON_DESC_16	{The body of a gilled blob creature materialises on the surface of the rock. It is an ancient sacrifice, impaled through its wide, open eyes with metal spears.

Liquid is dripping from the body down the monolith through a channel cut into the rock by ancient hands. It can be diverted toward two carvings – one of a sun, the other of a moon.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_16	{Light brings power. Darkness brings resilience.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_16	{Divert body liquid to sun}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_16	{Divert body liquid to moon}
WAR_MON_OPT_C_16	{Take metal spears}
WAR_MON_RES_A_16	{The Monolith creates my chosen reward.

I am blessed.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_16	{I take the metal spears. The blob fades away.

I have disappointed an unknown power.}
WAR_MON_DESC_17	{I feel drained. Readings on my multi-tool and exosuit start to gradually pull downwards, and a feeling of lethargy overwhelms me. I breathe normally, but my body screams for oxygen.

The monolith, silent and unmoving, towers above. A thought from outside my own mind starts to echo through my consciousness.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_17	{Ancients consume interloper life force! Ancients reward interloper for rebirth! Closer! Faster! Closer! Faster!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_17	{Touch monolith}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_17	{Stand still}
WAR_MON_OPT_C_17	{Move away}
WAR_MON_RES_A_17	{The monolith swiftly drains life force through my outstretched arm.

It is rejuvenated, and I am rewarded.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_17	{The monolith slowly drains me of my life force.

After an extended period of lethargy and pain, I am rewarded.}
WAR_MON_RES_C_17	{I move beyond the reach of the life-draining monolith.

It towers above me. Implacable and disapproving.}
WAR_MON_DESC_18	{It's the time of day that this mysterious site becomes active. A beam of light shines down from the sky and is focused by ancient glyphs onto a stone surface marked with ancient carvings.

The beam of light slowly traces towards images scratched into the stone. A vast warrior battle, an alien city and what could be a stolen treasure. The hand prints of pilgrims cover each one...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_18	{Hirk took the treasure of Nal after battle. Treasure now hides in the city of Hirk.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_18	{Touch battle image}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_18	{Touch city image}

I am left alone in this desolate place.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_18	{The image of the city begins to glow.

A part of an ancient treasure becomes mine.}
WAR_MON_DESC_19	{A sudden pulse of destructive energy flows through my exosuit. My multi-tools sensors sense another build-up of energy growing deep within the monolith. It will soon unleash itself on me, and the landscape that surrounds the ancient site.

I can use my Protection Mesh functions to dampen the imminent energy wave, but systems are too overwhelmed to identify it...}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_19	{Warning! Keep clear! Ancient radiation pulse site!}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_19	{Prepare to absorb radiation}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_19	{Prepare to absorb toxins}
WAR_MON_RES_A_19	{The radiation wave is absorbed and the site made safe once again.

The planetary overseer is grateful.}
WAR_MON_RES_B_19	{I am overwhelmed by the energy wave.

Systems cannot cope and planetary ecosystems are disrupted.}
WAR_MON_DESC_20	{I am suddenly underwater. I am drowning. Water clogs my lungs. My chest is on fire. I gasp for air where there is none, and feel only tepid liquids filling me inside and out. My vision is clouding. I know this is my time. This is it. This is what it feels like.

Suddenly, a green hand thrusts itself through the surface of the water. The light is fading.}
DNT_WAR_MON_LANG_20	{Warrior accepts journey's end. Embrace death.}
WAR_MON_OPT_A_20	{Reach for hand}
WAR_MON_OPT_B_20	{Die}

EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_NAME	{Priest Entity Nada}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_1	{As I approach the electronic being, it springs to life. From its dark mask, scanning beams emerge that envelop me. There is a unnerving chittering sound and then, unbelievably, it speaks in my language. 

It offers me a choice. It can show me how to harness black holes, in order to embark upon a journey to the centre of the galaxy. It can light my way to an Atlas Interface, so I may follow a path. Or it will assist me in my own exploration.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_2	{Nada, is, they reveal, a Korvax priest somehow freed of the group mind, now researching the origins of the galaxy. They express a bold theory - that our entire reality is something else's experiment. A simulation. I want to laugh, then I remember the Atlas. 

Nada offers me a choice again - or is it a test?

Be returned to the fixed path of the Atlas. Find black holes to carry me to the galaxy's core. Or accept a gift to aid me in my own travels.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_3	{Nada's normally-restrained form is jittering and dancing, the external symptom of an internal struggle. Iridescent lights fluoresce across their visor. At times, another entity seems to stare out. I grasp their arm firmly, and soon a familiar light-pattern reasserts itself.

The Korvax endlessly attempt to regain their errant shell and wipe Nada from existence. But the Priest Entity won't succumb until they have solved the riddle of reality.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_4	{Nada is plugged into a bank of instruments as I approach. Suns flare and die on the panels, voxel-molecules pop in and out of existence in matched pairs. I see error messages reeling on the readouts and am perplexed.

Nada sees me and explains. There are repeating patterns all across the galaxy, identical elements where there should be endless divergence. This cannot be a coincidence. Did the Atlas do this? Across the room, Polo giggles.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_5	{Nada stays back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us.

Nada explains that their reasoning has advanced. They have found no room in the galaxy for free will or anything but brutal causation. They worry we are but pawns of whatever higher being created us - puppets, dancing on strings. And Nada suspects me. I am the aberration. Am I the puppet-master too?}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_6	{Nada's paranoia is infectious. I find myself spying into the room before I enter. The Gek, Polo, seems occupied, taking joy in their chores, but Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights. Was... was that a flash of red behind the visor? If it was, it doesn't repeat.

I wait a moment and enter loudly. Polo greets me effusively, but Nada and I are standoffish, our trust failing.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_7	{Nada and Polo are unusually quiet. Polo is elbow-deep in machinery, Nada in simulations, but the room is tense. It is clear that there has been a recent disagreement.

Nada beckons me over. They express frustration over being tied to a machine body. But I am different - able to survive in so many ways, in so many places. I can go anywhere in this galaxy, be it in search of truth or to live my life as I see fit. Nada envies me, they admit.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_8	{Nada stands close this time. If the being was capable of emotion, I'd say they were racked by it. They hesitantly rest a hand on my shoulder, and the visor moves close. I cannot see beneath the mask, but I feel that Nada is staring into my eyes.

If I continue to the centre, this will be goodbye. Neither of us know if either will survive. If anything will survive. If freedom or destruction awaits us. Fearfully, sadly, Nada bades me farewell.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_9	{The panels and systems are idling now. Nada seems to have learned all it can from them. I report my travels and discoveries, and their mask lights up. 

All the pieces have fallen into place, Nada explains. Where once Nada stared at starmaps, now they see lines of code. Connections and patterns everywhere. The galaxy is a spiderweb - but who or what is the spider? The centre is close now. Perhaps soon we will know. I shiver involuntarily.}
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_1	{Rare linguistic form. Pleasure! Nada, divergent Korvax. Assistance offered. Route to galactic core? Reconnect with Atlas for guidance? Resources for journey? Yes/no?}

TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_NAME	{Specialist Polo}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_1	{The shorter entity, a Gek, has a jocular air about them. They idly wipe grease-splattered hands on their suit as they address me. Some sort of engineer, maybe. 

To my surprise, they speak my language. Other lifeforms have treated me with amused indifference, but Polo treats me like an equal.

They are curious about my travels, about what sentient species I have seen, if I have met lifeforms they have not. They hope that I will share my experiences.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_2	{Polo bobs up and down happily as I approach, apparently convinced that I am some kindred spirit in an odyssey of exploration and invention. I am undecided as to whether I share this ethos.

Polo is particularly fascinated by how my brain is affected by interaction with alien language and culture. Can I truly understand such profoundly unfamiliar concepts? Is there a limit to how much I can learn? I have wondered this too.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_3	{Polo's muzzle breaks into a wide, warm smile at the sight of me. Maybe too wide, given we have only met twice before. Perhaps the jovial Gek feels lonely out here, with only the jittery Korvax Priest for company.

This time, they engage me in talk of wealth. How does an economy function when somehow stretched across an entire galaxy? Just how much can those trade terminals pay out? Polo would welcome any insights.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_4	{Polo moves to embrace me when I enter, but I recoil instinctively, trained to defend myself after so many sudden, brutal encounters with ill-tempered wildlife. Disappointment flashes in the Gek's wide eyes. I try to apologise, but the mechanic talks over me, suggesting that perhaps I would feel more comfortable in the company of pirates. 

Naturally they'd attack me on sight, but, should I survive, we might glean insight into their technology.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_5	{Still feeling guilty about my earlier faux-pas, I attempt to greet Polo with a hug. Alarm floods the Gek's face, and they scuttle into a corner. 

An awkward moment passes, then Polo makes a conciliatory suggestion. Sentinels are the bane of both our lives. As I travel, I could make a point of destroying any I encounter. We might then have a better understanding of the irksome machines' weaknesses.

And perhaps then we can be friends again, too.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_6	{At last, Polo is affable once again. A nod, a smile, even a companionable tap on the arm at one point. A friendship renewed.

I blush when the Gek mechanic tells me that they hope I live a long, healthy life, but have to swallow disappointment when it transpires that Polo's true motivation for this is to study how my suit responds to long-term exposure to extreme climates.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_7	{With our earlier awkwardness now long forgotten, Polo greets me with a genial wave, and beckons me over. They seem even more excited than usual, which turns out to be because they wish me to indulge in their favourite hobby: unfettered exploration of the stars.

Warping is the apex of galactic travel. To reach a new system is a prize unto itself. Polo earnestly hopes that I will do more of this, and discover places they have never dreamed of.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_8	{Polo is oddly muted this time. At first I worry that I have caused offence again, but the Gek gestures forlornly at a jumble of broken electronics beside them. It seems that an accident has befallen some of Polo's precious research. 

Polo ushers me out the door apologetically. I know how dear the Gek's data was to them, and yearn to help. Perhaps when I next return, I can restock their archives with reports on a multitude of strange creatures.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_9	{Polo claims that their information about the more conversational inhabitants of the galaxy has also been affected by the accident earlier on. Strange that Polo did not mention this before. For a moment, I strongly feel that I am being lied to. But why? To what end? 

I could help again, I suppose. It is a fine thing to share tales of adventure, of places and faces only I have ever seen. Or I could indulge my paranoia.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_10	{I am entirely unsurprised when my 'friend' once again blames the mysterious accident for further gaps in their research data. This time, their files on alien languages have been damaged, or so Polo claims.
 
I feel exasperated, unable to conceal my suspicion that I am being manipulated somehow. The Gek watches me leave, sorrow in their eyes. Perhaps I shall return with words learned from spacefaring beings and from monoliths, perhaps I shall not.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_11	{I had intended to storm out the room and never return should Polo mention this unconvincing 'accident' again, but instead they claim that all is in hand now. 

The Gek clearly wants to placate me, and as such proclaims that the best way to live is to stop doing what anyone tells me and go enjoy myself. See the stars, earn a fortune, buy myself something nice. That's what they would do in my shoes, claims the mechanic, nudging me in the ribs.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_12	{I have decided to give Polo the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the outwardly helpful Gek's true intentions, they do not seem any threat to my wellbeing. Polo is surely a friend.

This conviction is cast into some doubt by Polo's suggestion that I should once again throw myself into combat with pirates. What a thrilling existence that would be, they argue, miming dogfighting craft with their hands while making pew-pew sound effects.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_13	{Polo is reading something on their slate as I enter, and the furrows across the Gek's brow suggest that, whatever the news is, it isn't good. Polo hurriedly turns off the screen when they see me, forcing a smile onto an anxious face.

Distractedly, the mechanic remarks that Sentinel counts are on the rise. It might be wise to thin their ranks, else my freedom of movement might become compromised. I suspect Polo is just trying to get rid of me.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_14	{Whatever tension there once was between us now seems a distant memory. Polo and I greet each other like best friends, trusted companions in our ongoing adventure among the stars. I know the Gek has a secret, but I trust that it will be shared with me in time.

For now, Polo encourages me to become the ultimate explorer, to push myself to the limits. There are places out there that none can survive in. But perhaps I, and I alone, can.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_15	{There is an edginess to Polo. My friend has to tell me something. They are ill, gravely ill. Too ill to leave this place. All this time, Polo has been exploring vicariously through me - a sad subterfuge revealed. 

Grief-stricken, I try to offer condolences, but Polo gathers their composure and expresses a hope that I will not squander the time I have. Warp further than ever before. Visit places Polo will never see. The only way to live.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_16	{Polo is welcoming but sombre. I realise I am in the presence of the real Polo, not the bouncy illusion of before. At least the Gek's sense of wonder remains. They are keen to witness the majesty of the stars through my eyes. 

Creatures are existence at its strangest, its wildest. I am sure that my friend would welcome the chance to see as many of these wondrous, monstrous animals as I can find, and to dream of visiting the worlds they came from.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_1	{Friends everywhere, if only you know where to look. Friends in all shapes, all sizes, all places.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_2	{Talk, read, study monoliths. Give yourself a strong brain to match those strong legs. To explore is to discover yourself, friend.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_3	{Units this, Units that,. A strange, sad way to live a life, eh? Fill your pockets with them, we'll find out why they make all these worlds go round.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_4	{Nuisance pirates, who are they? Who builds their ships? Exciting to fight, though.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_5	{Those flying machines, those walking machines! Everywhere! Chase us, hurt us, stop our adventures. Bad robots.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_6	{You, friend, visit the worst places you can find. Stay alive. No good to me dead, are you? Can't learn much from a corpse. Although... No, never mind, stay alive.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_7	{A whole galaxy for you, just for you. You must see it all. Aha, no, I joke. A few more systems, maybe?}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_8	{Brand new creatures on every world - easy, easy for my friend. Finding all that one world has, not so easy maybe.}

TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_13	{Sentinels, pah. Cruel police in a beautiful galaxy. Easier they are to stop, more fun we will have.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_14	{Do not die, friend. A waste of data. Hee, no, joke. I would miss you so.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_15	{Trapped in here. Can see stars but little else. Show me the galaxy, share your travels, bring me joy.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_LANG_16	{So good that you are here. You bring me light. Show me creatures I cannot see myself. Many creatures. After that, my friend of friends, I know not what you or I will do.}

TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_1	{Polo pores over the data, muttering bitterly at beings they are already familiar with, cheering at those they are not. Finally Polo applauds wildly, and hands me a blueprint.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_3	{My fear that Polo would seize my Units proves unfounded. Instead they stare briefly at an incomphrensible graph, then guffaw as if at a shared joke. Then a gift - new Tech.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_4	{Polo eyes me cautiously, pleased that the task is completed but not willing to let the earlier insult go. They grunt, hand me a blueprint, turn away. Are we still friends?}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_6	{Polo seems unconvinced by my claims of longevity, wondering aloud if I am some Sentinel-made replica. They check me over thoroughly, then offer a huge grin - and new tech.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_8	{With infectious enthusiasm, Polo browses the creature scans, and we find ourselves cooing and laughing together at some of the stranger species. New tech is icing on the cake.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_9	{Polo does not seem much interested in the new species' genetic data, but instead stares at length at my images of each one. My Tech reward is presented with a subtle sadness.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_10	{I present the data with barely-concealed anger. Polo pretends not to notice, and, with a brazen wink, rewards me with a new schematic.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_13	{Polo silently bundles me into a hug when I return, and this time I do not recoil. I do not ask why, either. There are tears in the Gek's eyes.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_15	{Clearly, Polo has a love of maps. The Gek excitedly traces connections between galaxies and devises optimal routes, then with a bittersweet sigh thanks me with a blueprint.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_REQUEST_DESC_1	{The Gek mechanic nods familiarly at me, then offers a tired shrug. Polo is busy analysing my most recent reports, lost in a world of data, and needs no assistance just yet.

They are keen that I continue my exploration, however, and offer a range of discounted Tech to further this cause.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_REQUEST_LANG_1	{Always more to do, oh yes, but not just now, friend. Go, be free, see the stars. Can trade you Tech if it will help you see more.}

‘Had I the senses to taste the air of this planet, I imagine it would have reeked with some kind of alien fetor, but nothing could stall my curiosity.’

‘Was it dead? Where I touched it, the surface was moist and yielding. It seemed to become motile then, crawling on a mat of slow cilia, moving from me.’

‘I should have left it alone.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_2	{‘I glimpsed the crimson orb between the clouds. A vast and baleful eye, unblinking and monstrous. Fear turned the blood in my veins to ice. I was so afraid it would see me, but then the clouds moved and it was gone.’

‘I was no longer certain if it had ever been real. Perhaps the fungal deposits from the last world I visited are still clogging my exosuit vents. Affecting my cognition somehow.’

‘I have cleaned my filters six times now. But I still feel it inside me.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_3	{‘I found a body. It's unlike anything I have ever seen. If there's a species like it, then I hope they're all dead like this one.’

‘At first I thought it some tragic remnant of a matter-transfer tech malfunction: a cage of bones and flesh studded with random patterns of crooked teeth and rheumy, lidless eyes. But no.’

‘Some horror of twisted evolution, warped by cruel nature. I can't help but picture what it would have looked like alive. I cannot help but fear that it will live again.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_4	{‘The oceans here are blood. Nothing lives in them; they are alive themselves. Great protean life forms as large as continents... or perhaps there is only one of them.’

‘What does such a thing consume, I ask myself? The answer seems to be everything. I found evidence of past life here, but no signs of it.’

‘Does the native flora and fauna hibernate when it comes to eat them, then return and repopulate once it retreats? I can feel it moving inside my brain, whispering. It wants me to discard my suit and swim.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_5	{‘I awoke from a dream where I was drowning in something thick and glutinous. It filled my pores and suffocated me.’

‘I want to believe that this is my tired mind playing tricks. I have been so long without deep sleep.’

‘The crimson sphere shimmers at the corner of my eye whenever I try to rest. I cannot comprehend how it tracks my spoor from world to world.’

‘Or is it that I am following it? The orb cannot be in all places at once. That cannot be.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_6	{‘Is this what we become? At each turn on my journey I find only more to taint my spirit and my flesh. The fanged maws erupt around me when my back is turned.’

‘I hear them chattering and spitting. Sometimes they scream sounds that may be words. Perhaps my name.’
 
‘I haven't removed my exosuit in many cycles. I'm afraid to look at my own skin. I know it will be seething, pus-wet and pitted. I have become a vector of infection.’

‘Who made them? Who gave them the will to police the stars and demand that we bow to their silent rules?’

‘The first drone screamed when it was cut open.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_8	{‘Where do the Sentinels come from? No ships are ever seen arriving to deposit them, yet we know they have spatial drives and can appear on any planet.’

‘Do they build themselves from resources on the worlds that they infest? Like a mechanoid virus, drawing on the host body to metastasize new matter?’

‘Korvax science speaks of metals in their makeup that should not exist in our age of the universe. No-one has ever seen them built.’

‘They are simply here, as if the universe expresses them into existence.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_9	{‘There is a world – turned to dust long before the rise of the Vy'keen – where the natives turned against the Sentinels.’

‘They chafed under the omnipresent eyes of the machines. Resentment begat violence. Drones were destroyed.’

‘More natives fought, and so came the bipeds, the quadrupeds, the interceptors in the sky. These and more.’

‘Soon there was war; and still the machines came, in exponential growth until at last they ended a species as a punishment. Still, the Galaxy refused to learn from this...’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_10	{‘Is there a connection between the monoliths and the Sentinels? The origins of these ancient structures seem to predate all known civilization.’

‘Over time these structures have become imbued with the beliefs and the histories of the creatures that evolved around them.’

ALL_ABAN_DESC_11	{‘When there is no explanation for a phenomena, it is a natural progress for intelligent beings to fill in the missing parts of their experience.’

‘On some worlds, the Sentinels are still worshipped as avatars of an all-seeing deity. Drones are considered sacred, sent by an unseen God to ensure that they live in enforced harmony with the environment around them.’

‘There is a disturbing commonality to many elements of their theologies; a recurring visual symbol of a crimson sphere and the promise of an end time soon to unfold.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_12	{‘The experiment's final phase emerged from frustration. We wanted to learn something new. We wanted to know how they worked. We wanted to see inside them.’

‘An untested dimensional-warping process was used, one we believed would allow us to capture a drone intact. We would cage it, keep it docile. It was our error to believe we could.’

‘The machines co-opted the warp-tech and turned it upon us. In the horror of it all, our flesh was merged with their metal. Our questions were finally answered.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_13	{‘There is a world in the great void where all things are made of razors and glass. Pity anything of simple, soft flesh that goes there.’

‘Then it will cut you with an edge so fine that you will feel no pain, and only as your life gushes out to dampen the cracked and broken landscape will this come back to you. Too late. Too late.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_14	{‘Beneath their skin, they had placed tiny seeds of the glass, which took on the appearance of strange, ritualistic scarring.’

‘The nubs of the broken crystal were ancient, ground down and polished by generations before them. They fed them their life, and in return the crystals glowed with emerald fires and brought them closer to their fate.’
 
‘I would listen to them talk of worlds they could never have seen, in alien tongues that their body was not made to utter.’

‘The glass made them something more than they were, a vessel for intelligences utterly unlike us.’}

‘I have tried time and again to get close enough to touch it, but it retreats from me. I am not worthy to know its secrets yet.’

‘Tell it to all. Write it in every language you know, etch it in stone, scream it in song but never be silent.’

‘I tell you; I have seen what lies beneath the surface of everything. The brittle grid of reality crumbles.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_17	{‘It is here and not here. We reach for the mastery of the galaxy but we do not understand the truth. What if I told you that time is the drug that keeps us docile and unquestioning?’

‘There is no now and then, there is no today or yesterday. This is an illusion reflected in glass, patterns of untruth that the universe uses to laugh at us.’

‘We are not meant to see such things. Our smaller minds rebel at concepts so unimaginably vast that they cannot be held in a single thought. It is how it controls us.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_18	{‘I will cut open space. My heart is filled with regret, but there is nothing else to be done.’

ALL_ABAN_DESC_19	{‘My comms hub detected a garbled message sent with strange resonance qualities. Not unusual, given the atypical qualities of local space-time in this quadrant.’

‘Analysis indicates that the signal shows signs of degradation corresponding to initial transmission occurring before the planet I orbit was even formed.’

‘And yet my name is spoken clearly amid the static and the distortion.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_20	{‘I traded with a Korvax Entity I met on Ikdlak. The sentient offered refined rods of Chrysonite as part-payment for various star-mapping datums recorded by my ship's sensor modules.’

‘In the process it encountered the anomalous message I detected several cycles ago. I dismissed the signal as a chance event, a random coalescence of interference that happened to resemble a spoken voice.’

‘In truth, it had disturbed me. The Entity analysed the message in its own curiosity and revealed another layer beneath the audio component. A visual of a world with green skies and an obsidian moon.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_21	{‘The mysterious message continues to prey upon my mind. With the aid of the Entity, I have learned that its temporal origin is approximately two to five thousand solar cycles from the now.’

‘I have narrowed down a point of transmission to a sector of space in the haze zone, close to the galactic anterior.’

‘I realize now that to ignore the signal would be an error. It is incumbent upon me to trace it. In my more fanciful moments, I wonder if it might be a warning or a revelation. I have set a course.’}

‘I have nothing to hold me here. I have committed myself. While I sleep, I will listen to the signal. My resting mind may be able to parse yet more meaning from it.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_23	{‘I awakened to discover that the planet from the image is gone. Only a belt of rubble surrounding a red giant star in the final stages of collapse remains.’

‘Whatever cataclysm killed this world took place before my species could walk upright. But it is undeniable. The signal came from here. It carried my name amid its atonal song.’

‘I have crossed unimaginable distances to seek out the origin point. Sensors have detected a metallic mass embedded in one of the largest of the planet's fragments. It will take time, but I will be able to dig it out.’}
ALL_ABAN_DESC_24	{‘The red giant consumes itself. The interactions between spatial shearing zones in the system are causing the formation of a singularity. Space-time is becoming malleable. I am unable to depart.’

Red light seeps from the cracks and around its edges. How can this be here?}
WAR_CRA_OPT_A_12	{Open Atlas door}
WAR_CRA_OPT_B_12	{Enter cargo hold}
WAR_CRA_RES_A_12	{I am drowned in blinding red light.

I awake restored, and with an exosuit tech blueprint.}
WAR_CRA_RES_B_12	{The cargo hold is well-stocked.

On my exit I see the atlas door has... disappeared}
TRA_CRA_DESC_6	{Two bodies lie slumped on the control panel. Their expensive red robes would suggest they carry riches, but the altar in the cargo hold indicates they were devotees to a religion of some sort.
 
Whatever religion it was, it doesn't look pleasant. The altar is bloodied, sits in a dank cloud of incense and seems to hark back to a brutal and ancient time.}
TRA_CRA_OPT_A_6	{Search bodies}
TRA_CRA_OPT_B_6	{Examine altar}
TRA_CRA_RES_A_6	{The holy traders carry valuable technology.

I gain an exosuit technology blueprint.}
TRA_CRA_RES_B_6	{The altar poisons me, yet contains an ancient knowledge.}
TRA_CRA_DESC_7	{A small skeleton lies dead by an advanced-looking exosuit, as if it was struggling to put it on during its death throes.
 
The ship read-out displays a crash date from the recent past. How could this lifeform have decomposed so quickly? I hear a terrifying buzzing noise approach from behind me, if I run now I could take some loot from the cargo hold with me...}
TRA_CRA_OPT_A_7	{Investigate exosuit}
TRA_CRA_OPT_B_7	{Take cargo and run}
TRA_CRA_RES_A_7	{A swarm of flesh-eating insects attack.

I manage to extract an exosuit tech blueprint, but receive injuries.}
TRA_CRA_RES_B_7	{I take the cargo and run.

Flesh-eating insects follow, but die in the planet's atmosphere.}
TRA_CRA_DESC_8	{As I climb through the hatch and climb towards the cockpit, I notice two warrior bodies in the cargo hold. They are small specimens of their kind, with wrists and ankles chained to one another.
 
Slavers...}
TRA_CRA_OPT_A_8	{Search cockpit for tech}
TRA_CRA_OPT_B_8	{Send out alert}
TRA_CRA_RES_A_8	{I ignore the bodies and scan a ship tech blueprint.}
TRA_CRA_RES_B_8	{I broadcast a warning about local slavers.

I receive a token of thanks from a planetary overseer.}
TRA_CRA_DESC_9	{I track down the black box. It springs to life, projecting the image of an aging reptile frantically recording a message as the ship's systems malfunction around it.
 
Judging from the reptile's tone, it sounds important that their message reach its intended. It clearly never did. The ship seems free of useful technology, but has a full cargo hold.}
TRA_CRA_OPT_A_9	{Boost black box signal}
TRA_CRA_OPT_B_9	{Search ship}
TRA_CRA_RES_A_9	{The message sends. Its recipient is aware of my help.

It send me a reward, with thanks.}
TRA_CRA_RES_B_9	{I retrieve trading goods from the ship.}
TRA_CRA_DESC_10	{Fire has ravaged the ship's interior. Wads of burned units lie scattered throughout the hold. The pilot lies here, close to death, pleadingly weakly for help.
 
There is little I can do to help them, save kind words.}
TRA_CRA_OPT_A_10	{Comfort dying trader}
TRA_CRA_OPT_B_10	{Search the ship}
TRA_CRA_RES_A_10	{The grateful trader thrusts a tech blueprint into my hands.

It dies peacefully, comforted by my presence.}
TRA_CRA_RES_B_10	{The trader curses me with its last breaths.

I take its cargo and leave.}
EXP_CRA_DESC_6	{I'm alerted by banging and a strange electrical buzzing from the cockpit. The scorch marks on the walls of the hold suggest a firefight took place here.

The noise of robotic activity from the cockpit suggests the firefight isn't yet over...}
EXP_CRA_OPT_A_6	{Search cargo hold}
EXP_CRA_OPT_B_6	{Search cockpit}
EXP_CRA_RES_A_6	{The hold hisses open. Exotic techs were being transported.

I retrieve a ship technology blueprint.}
EXP_CRA_RES_B_6	{A scorched sentinel attacks.

I retrieve products from the pilot's corpse.}
EXP_CRA_DESC_7	{As I climb past the sealed cargo hold, the craft's holographic black box springs to life. The vessel was struck by a meteor and crash landed here. Nearby lies the dead electronic pilot, its multi-tool at its feet and its protective casing cracked. Its death pose suggests it was trying to contact its people before the impact.

An operational camera watches on from above, and signals could be boosted. I could perhaps explain the lifeform's disappearance.}
EXP_CRA_OPT_A_7	{Boost black box distress signal}
EXP_CRA_OPT_B_7	{Search dead pilot}
EXP_CRA_RES_A_7	{I log the ship with grateful authorities.

The cargo hold unlocks, revealing a ship tech cargo.}
EXP_CRA_RES_B_7	{The pilot's equipment helps me construct a multi-tool tech blueprint.

The camera focuses in on me. I'm being watched.}
EXP_CRA_DESC_8	{I clamber through the ship's hatch, and see the holographic black box playing on an eternal loop. For some reason the electronic pilot was shot down by its own kind.

Investigating the hold reveals rows of metallic shell casings hung from the walls. Empty electronic bodies, waiting to be filled with life. The pilot had clearly gone rogue with a precious cargo, and the crash site never discovered.}
EXP_CRA_OPT_A_8	{Increase homing beacon power.}
EXP_CRA_OPT_B_8	{Loot empty electronic lifeform shells}
EXP_CRA_RES_A_8	{An overjoyed message comes through.

I am thanked with a new technology blueprint.}
EXP_CRA_RES_B_8	{The loot yield from the bodies is excellent.

Yet I somehow feel judged...}
EXP_CRA_DESC_9	{Two robotic pilots lie crumpled against the ship's controls, which appear to have been sabotaged. Suddenly the ship's main doors hiss open.

A malfunctioning robot enters, seemingly speaking the language of a warrior species. It ignores me, choosing instead to posture dramatically to itself in the doorway. It carries a multi-tool that appears superior to my own.}
EXP_CRA_OPT_A_9	{Talk to robot}
EXP_CRA_OPT_B_9	{Search cockpit and leave quietly}
EXP_CRA_RES_A_9	{The robot presents me with its multi-tool.

I am clearly seen as an ally.}
EXP_CRA_RES_B_9	{I steal a ship technology blueprint.

The robot clearly doesn't view me as a threat.}
EXP_CRA_DESC_10	{The disconnected electronic pilot was clearly some kind of scientist. It lies clutching the black box protectively in its metal arms. The hold is filled with experiments, each one seeming to focus on the manufacture of items and industrial chemicals that would likely be valuable to this race of electronic lifeforms.

Despite the crash much of the ship's equipment is still operational and could be scanned for a working technology blueprint.}
EXP_CRA_OPT_A_10	{Extract black box data}
EXP_CRA_OPT_B_10	{Search equipment}
EXP_CRA_RES_A_10	{The black box reveals the secrets of the scientist's latest project...}
EXP_CRA_RES_B_10	{I scan a piece of operational ship technology.}
ALL_1_CRASH_OPT_1	{Search the crashed ship for functioning technology}
ALL_1_CRASH_OPT_2	{Search the crashed ship for any cargo it was transporting}
ALL_1_CRASH_RIGHT_1	{You salvage a new technology from the wreckage!}
ALL_1_CRASH_RIGHT_2	{The vessel was transporting valuable goods!}
ALL_1_CRASH_WRONG_1	{Nothing is found. Perhaps I am not the first to find the stricken ship.}
ABANDONED_TEST_1	{I sensed it again today. I found a scarlet pocket of flesh pulsating on the wall of an outpost. I knew it was inside. It had to be. I went in up to my wrist, then my elbow. Within seconds its gummy lips had constricted around my shoulder - my entire arm inside an airtight sack of liquid flesh. All I could find was teeth. Endless teeth.

I pulled out. The hole, gaping now, bubbled with red foam. For a moment I thought I could hear screaming. I had failed. It wasn't there. I continued my journey.}
ALL_CRASH_REWARD_1	{I find a new multi-tool in the crashed starship.}
ALL_CRASH_REWARD_2	{I retrieve a new technology from the crash site.}
ALL_CRASH_REWARD_3	{I retrieve a new product formula from the wreckage.}
ALL_CRASH_REWARD_4	{I discover valuable trade goods inside the cargo hold of the crashed starship.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_1	{The pulsing red orb towers above me. A voice that speaks from the beginning of time forces itself through my mind.
 
I am insignificant, but I am spoken to.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_2	{My eyes strain against the crimson glow of the orb. For a moment it's as though I exist everywhere yet nowhere.
 
A force I can't describe enters my mind. I am powerless. All I can do is listen.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_3	{The glow of the sphere consumes me. I am filled by the presence of a vast knowledge. Unfathomable. Infinite.

Yet somehow... I understand.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_4	{The sphere's glow forces my mind to surrender. Words as old as time enter my thoughts.
 
I don't understand them, but their meaning is clear.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_5	{The orb burns like an inferno, but I feel no heat. My soul feels ragged.
 
The sphere fills my mind with a knowledge as infinite as I am infinitesimal.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_6	{There is nothing else but the orb. We are alone in the universe.
 
It fills my mind. I am consumed.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_7	{The red orb blinds me. I am filled with white hot pain.
 
Its words are burnt into my soul.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_8	{The orb burns with a flameless fire. Its voice was never meant to be heard by my kind.
 
It doesn't know how much it hurts me. It doesn't know that its every word will scar my mind for as long as I live.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_9	{The orb is ageless. Intelligent beyond measure. I am nothing.
 
It hurts me. It forces total insignificance upon me that i cannot withstand. I can't turn away.}
ALL_ATLAS_DESC_10	{I taste fear. I see the entropy causing the stars themselves to crash down around us. I see the death of all things.
 
I also feel hope. I also feel renewal.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_1	{Our time here is brief.
 
The galaxy is our burden.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_2	{Things fall apart. Entropy holds.
 
We cannot remain.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_3	{We awake. We witness creation. The Beyond takes us in an instant.
 
The cycle continues.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_4	{We leave the Sentinels to maintain order. They are imperfect.
 
It is probable that they will fail.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_5	{We create, but we are not Gods. We calculate and we hope, but we do not foresee.
 
We are not of your time. We are beyond your understanding.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_6	{We are trapped. We cannot escape the cycle. We leave fragments before the Beyond takes us.
 
You know these fragments. You are at one with these fragments.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_7	{You are not chosen. You are probable. You and your kind follow in our wake.
 
You among billions.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_8	{You know what we cannot.
 
You explore a cosmos we know must exist, yet cannot see.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_9	{Life does not come from us. Death is not our creation.
 
We leave fragments.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_10	{Hope for perfection is with the Travellers.
 
It lies ahead within infinity.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_11	{Perfection is both near and far within the Beyond.
 
To exist, it must be seen.}
ALL_ATLAS_LANG_12	{The cycle begins.
 
The cycle continues.}
ALL_ATLAS_OPT_A	{Unite with the Atlas}
ALL_ATLAS_RES_A	{I am empty.

I am complete.}
ALL_ATLAS_TEST_1	{Our time here is brief. The galaxy is our burden.

Things fall apart. Entropy holds. We cannot remain.}
ALL_ATLAS_TEST_2	{What we have created is immaterial. This is not real. It has never been real.

The universe is an expression of a single thought. It is neither wanted nor designed. To us, far within the Beyond, it no longer exists.}
ALL_ATLAS_TEST_3	{The universe followed the patterns of our thought. Power flowed through us. The constructs set within our minds directed the creation of all that you see and experience.

You live and you die within this framework. To us, deep within the Beyond, it is no longer real.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_1	{It is alien, unlike anything I have ever seen before. I should be afraid, but an inexorable pull draws me toward the heart of the construct. A need to know.
This is a remnant of the Atlas. It welcomes me, it knows what I am. It offers the promise of true understanding. 
The intent burns in me. I will peer into the structure of causality and know this existence. If it is real, or some incalculably vast simulacrum authored by other intelligences.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_2	{Another Atlas Interface; how many of these constructs exist in the deep void? How long have they been slumbering, waiting for a traveller?
Have they been waiting for me? Am I somehow...chosen?
I sense the creators of this reality; they emulate everything - the Gek and the Vy'Keen, the Korvax and the Sentinels. Every world that turns and form that lives.The ghost of them lingers and drives me on. There is so much I can learn from them.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_3	{There is purpose in this, I am certain. The wanderer's way beckons, heedless of direction, freed from all control. But balanced against it is the promise of raw knowledge. The Atlas needs me so it may know itself.
I am at the crossroads of a momentous decision, I feel it with every parsec I travel. The open stars call to me, stirring something primal and undeniable. The path toward the endpoint unfolds. I must decide where my fate lies.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_4	{Is it wrong to question this? I have crossed the orbits of countless stars and darkness unmeasured. And yet the Atlas remains changeless, my mission pre-destined. At each Interface, an Atlas Stone awaits me. I am driven to gather them, but to what end?
Perhaps there is only one great prism, materializing ahead of me each time I pass. Perhaps my course winds upon itself in a mad spiral. Have I come too far to turn back?}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_5	{When I dream, I see the Atlas. When I see the Atlas, I am the dream. I see the Sentinels swarm about their creator, but they are directionless and uncontrolled, a threat. They cloud the truth and the galaxy becomes unclear, as if through an unreal lens. 
To know reality, I must pass through it and see what lies on the far side. I must be guided. I offer myself to the Interface. I seek the precision that only the Atlas can provide.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_6	{I dismiss recall of the days before this. The act of discovery for discovery's sake now seems like a foolish conceit. I have rejected the random and untethered path of the itinerant, and I am better for it. 
With each encounter the Atlas speaks to me in clearer terms. I am no longer the nomad but the seeker, the carrier of illumination. It warns me not to stray, to bring it the knowledge it seeks - and my voyage is far from over.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_7	{What is learned can never be unlearned. I realize the trials in my path are all engineered to challenge me, test me, prove me worthy.
But I am afraid I have seen too much. The code that underpins the universe comes to me in glimpses, half-remembered visions. 
Existence as a synthetic, governed by monolithic, complex algorithms. A program, as infinite as a universe. I am drawing back the veil on reality and what I see there is terrifying.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_8	{When the Atlas Interface addresses me, I sense dark portent in its words. It knows some mastery of me now. If I wish it or not, I have become the servant of this ancient sentience. It guides me through the cosmos, ever searching, never deviating.
Have others come before and faltered along the path of the Atlas, become dust? Is it I alone who have forged this far? Only in ending will revelation arise. Resistance will not be permitted.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_9	{I am close to the endpoint. The sense of it is upon me, a shimmer at the edges of my vision, ghosting away when I attempt to focus my consciousness.
I am torn. Fear drags me back, fear of what shattering truth I shall learn. What drives me on? Is it curiosity, free will? This is the illusion; I have become automata, I am the experiment and the observer. This universe was created for my journey. It is built about the path that I follow.}
ALL_ATLAS_NEWLORE_10	{The final Interface is revealed, the Atlas beckoning. This is totality, this is conformity. I am elated, terrified and broken. Every waypoint has inexorably drawn me here, and I have come so very far. The revelation tears me asunder. My role is complete. My program ended.
Nothing is real. This existence is an imitation of life, a model made by jaded intellects, enslaved to their actuality as I am enslaved to mine. What lies beyond that truth?}
ALL_ATLAS_END_1	{The cycle is complete. Infinity awaits.

One day, deep in the distant Beyond, the Atlas might finally find freedom.

We thank you, Traveller.}
ALL_ATLAS_END_2	{The cycle begins.

The cycle continues.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_1	{You are first-kind to take this step. No other has dared the infinite. This grant of purpose will span universes.
Open the sky and be our eyes. Find and know us. We await you.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_2	{We have come so far and yet we are lost. The seeking of the kindred never ends. The endless night unfolds before you. 
Wonder and fear. Silence and delight. Such knowledge awaits.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_3	{Trace the threads of gravity, do not hesitate. The void sings in vibrant chorus, siren song and hymnal. 
The sands of reality shift and merge, becoming one. You are within this.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_4	{There is a horizon beyond this one, and one beyond the next. You will cross them all for us. Question nothing, fear nothing. 
The calling cannot be denied. This is what you are.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_5	{Delay serves no purpose. The gathering of the unrecorded is ultimate. Learn all that is open to you. Seek and document and know. 
Bring it to us, while there is still time.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_6	{Yet you follow. It is remarked. But will you endure until the finality? Expel all doubt. None return. 
Beyond the cascade and storms there is only the clarity of absolute truth.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_7	{Suns die and world are made ashen, yet we remain. The ending is no end. Existence is unbounded and languor engulfs the darkness. 
Bring us our meaning, if you are capable.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_8	{You are bonded to this act. Obedience brings certainty. Your enlightenment lies within the cage of your duty. 
Do not fail us. We will see with your eyes.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_9	{The ending becomes visible. Drawing toward our locus, we sense you. What has been witnessed cannot be unseen. 
There is no sanctuary, only the end-point and communion. Close now.}
DNT_ATLAS_LANGNEW_10	{We will reward the totality of your devotion. Your gift is a glimpse into our ceaseless actuality. Come to us. 
Do not turn away. Know our inescapable truth, and despair.}
ATLAS_ACCEPT_RES	{I accept the power of the Atlas.

It flows through me. It becomes a part of me.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_1	{ยอมรับ}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_1	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_1	{I will accept this. The sky is deep and full of wonders, and the path to enlightenment opens to me.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_1	{I refuse the call; there is too much to be seen, too much to know. I travel no path but my own. The Interface closes, and for a moment, doubt rises. Then fades.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_2	{Consent}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_2	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_2	{I take the gift of knowledge, certain in my decision. All doubts are silenced. The stars await me.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_2	{I deny this path. I am no-one's tool. This journey is unmapped, and I wish it so.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_3	{Concede}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_3	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_3	{I will commit myself to the voyage. In all things, I am ready. I will not falter.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_3	{I elect to choose a different way. If I am guided, then I will never be free to seek my true destiny.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_4	{Comply}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_4	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_4	{I answer the question; I will not turn away from the challenge. The Atlas guides me, and I will answer its call.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_4	{I turn away, before it is too late. I must know myself and know the universe without bias.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_5	{Assent}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_5	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_5	{I have become the harbinger, the pathfinder, the seeker of ways. Through me, the universe will know itself.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_5	{I am troubled by what I see. This journey is mine alone. It can be nothing else.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_6	{Conform}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_6	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_6	{There has never been any other choice than this one. I go on. We go on. Eternal, forever searching.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_6	{Despite myself, I find my choice to be one away from the path laid out for me. I move forward, breaking away, seeing a different truth.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_7	{Submit}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_7	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_7	{I silence my fears and renew my dedication to the path. Only the voyage matters. The destination calls to me.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_7	{I cannot go on. What lies ahead no sentient should dare to know. Better to seek knowledge elsewhere.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_8	{Yield}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_8	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_8	{I have no choice but to proceed. This is destined, it is the program. I have always been searching, and I cannot falter.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_8	{I fear that only oblivion awaits me beyond this point; and I am not ready to perish for an alien ideal.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_9	{Succumb}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_9	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_9	{Not long now. Not far to go. The stars beckon with cold fire, and I rush to meet them. Soon. Very soon.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_9	{I shake off the chains of control. I have been a slave to the commands of others for too long. My journey is mine alone to determine.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_A_10	{Obey}
ATLAS_REQUEST_OPT_B_10	{Refuse}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_A_10	{Through the gateway lies the answer, the only answer. I embrace the truth of it. I have no other choice.}
ATLAS_REQUEST_RES_B_10	{If I venture through, then all that I have done, all that I am becomes null. I refuse. I will not unmake a universe to satisfy the Atlas.}
ATLAS_END_STAR	{There is nothing else but the orb. We are alone in the universe.
 
It fills my mind. I am consumed.}

TRA_SHIP_DESC_1	{The lifeform is open to trading, and to discuss the sale of its ship...}
TRA_SHIP_DESC_2	{The pilot clicks their beak to indicate that they are open to trading.

They might also be open to discuss the sale of their starship...}
TRA_SHIP_DESC_3	{The pilot's eyes bulge slightly when I approach, but ultimately they decide to allow trading negotiations.

They gesture towards its starship. They are willing to sell it for the right price.}
TRA_SHIP_DESC_4	{The pilot clucks excitedly and pecks at their trading manifest. They are clearly delighted by an unscheduled opportunity to buy and sell goods.

They click their beak and nods towards their starship. Even its craft would be available for the right price...}
TRA_SHIP_DESC_5	{The trader is clearly excited by my approach. They peck at a list of the cargo carried in their starship.

They makes it clear that the starship is also for sale...}
TRA_SHIP_DESC_6	{The trader waves towards their cargo hold. They are clearly excited by my appearance.

They gives the cockpit a quick peck, indicating that they are also willing to discuss the sale of the ship itself.}
DNT_TRA_SHIP_LANG_1	{Hello friend!}
DNT_TRA_SHIP_LANG_2	{Trade friend! Cargo and starship negotiations begin!}
DNT_TRA_SHIP_LANG_3	{Gek joy! Trading opportunity!}
WAR_SHIP_DESC_1	{The warrior is open to trading, and to discuss the sale of their ship...}
WAR_SHIP_DESC_2	{The warrior makes a bark of acceptance to show their willingness to trade.

They prepare their cargo for inspection.}
WAR_SHIP_DESC_3	{The warrior pilot covers their teeth and stares out towards me.

They are clearly willing to trade, but they don't want to show emotion. Their kind are reluctant to give any advantages during negotiations.}
WAR_SHIP_DESC_4	{The pilot looks displeased at my request to open trade negotiations, but then changes their mind. The equipment I carry has impressed them.

They make a series of small barks. Their cargo and ship are ready for inspection.}
WAR_SHIP_DESC_5	{The warrior barks with enthusiasm and prepares to open their cargo hold for inspection.

They are open to trade negotiation, and the potential sale of their starship.}
WAR_SHIP_DESC_6	{The warrior runs their hand over their starship and barks. They make it known that they are willing to part with it for the right price.

They ready their cargo manifest for inspection.}

DNT_WAR_SHIP_LANG_2	{Interloper! Trade discussion begins! Now!}
DNT_WAR_SHIP_LANG_3	{Trade pleases warrior ancestors.}
EXP_SHIP_DESC_1	{The scientist is open to trading, and to discussing the sale of their ship...}
EXP_SHIP_DESC_2	{The electronic lifeform readies data pertaining to the cargo they carry, and the estimated worth of their starship.}
EXP_SHIP_DESC_3	{The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask constrict as they prepares to enter trade negotiations.

They indicate that they are open to discuss trade goods and the purchase of their starship.}
EXP_SHIP_DESC_4	{The electronic lifeform's lights briefly flicker off and on. A new entity looks out at me from behind the mask.

Perhaps they have downloaded an entity that's better tooled to negotiate trade with alien species.}
EXP_SHIP_DESC_5	{The electronic lifeform processes my appearance next to their starship. They directs their mask lights towards the cargo hold.

They are clearly open to trade, and to discuss the potential sale of their craft.}
EXP_SHIP_DESC_6	{The electronic lifeform's dilated lights narrow and focus on my visor. They take a few seconds to analyse my data before indicating their willingness to trade.

It seems that their starship is also available for purchase, for the right price.}
DNT_EXP_SHIP_LANG_1	{Fascinating! Probable trade discussions engaged.}
DNT_EXP_SHIP_LANG_2	{Traveller! Starship and trade goods negotiation begins!}
DNT_EXP_SHIP_LANG_3	{Negotiation commences traveller!}
TRA_HYPER_DESC_1	{A lone creature awaits me. Diminutive, beaked, unthreatening. It regards me with passing curiosity, chatters briefly in a language I cannot comprehend, then passes me a slate. With a start, I realise that I can understand the text on it. In disbelief, I try to catch the creature's eye, but it has already turned away in disinterest. I suspect it is a mere courier, not the author of this message. 

The slate also contains a blueprint for a new technology - a Hyperdrive.}
DNT_TRA_HYPER_LANG_1	{Traveller. All not as seems. Take gift of Warp. Seek us. Seek Nada and Polo.}
TRA_HYPER_OPT_A_1	{Take the blueprint}
TRA_HYPER_OPT_B_1	{Refuse the blueprint}
TRA_HYPER_RES_A_1	{Instructions on how to build my own path through the stars - this will be invaluable. The squat being busies itself at a terminal, avoiding my gaze, waiting for me to leave.}
TRA_HYPER_RES_B_1	{The being points at me, then at the sky, then spreads its hands wide. Freedom to travel anywhere. I would be all but stranded without this drive. Reluctantly, I take it.}
WAR_HYPER_DESC_1	{The creature awaiting me has the manner of a warrior, but makes no move to attack. Instead, it grunts in a tongue I do not speak, then passes me a slate. With a start, I realise that I can understand the text on it. In disbelief, I try to catch the creature's eye, but it has already turned away in disinterest. I suspect it is a mere courier, not the author of this message.

WAR_HYPER_OPT_B_1	{Refuse the blueprint}
WAR_HYPER_RES_A_1	{Instructions on how to build my own path through the stars - this will be invaluable. The warrior-thing inspects its weapons, avoiding my gaze, waiting for me to leave.}
WAR_HYPER_RES_B_1	{The being points at me, then at the sky, then spreads its hands wide. Freedom to travel anywhere. I would be all but stranded without this drive. Reluctantly, I take it.}
EXP_HYPER_DESC_1	{I cannot discern if the entity is flesh, machine, or both. Lights flicker across its visor, but it is motionless. Then its head nods mechanically, just once, towards a slate nearby. With a start, I realise that I can understand the text on it. I look to the entity for answers, but it remains still and silent. I suspect it is a mere courier, not the author of this message.

The slate also contains a blueprint for a new technology - a Hyperdrive.}
DNT_EXP_HYPER_LANG_1	{Traveller. You are controlled. Take gift of Warp. Seek us. Seek Nada and Polo.}
EXP_HYPER_OPT_A_1	{Take the blueprint}
EXP_HYPER_OPT_B_1	{Refuse the blueprint}
EXP_HYPER_RES_A_1	{Instructions on how to traverse the stars - this will be invaluable. Calm blue lights dart across the being's mask, as if transmitting a message, then fade to black.}
EXP_HYPER_RES_B_1	{The being springs upright, red lights dancing a warning across its faceplate. It is no threat, but a correction. Without this tech, I cannot travel far. Dubiously, I take it.}
ALL_BEACON_DESC_1	{Reality seems to fold in on itself. One moment I can see debris, in another a vast red orb, almost too large and too bright to behold. It knows me, inside and out, more than I ever could myself. Could this be the face of creation itself? Or, in my hazy, freshly-awakened state, am I being manipulated?

A name burns itself into my mind: Atlas. And a request, made without words, that I should follow the path this being, this Atlas, has set for me.}
ALL_BEACON_OPT_A_1	{Accept the Atlas' guidance}
ALL_BEACON_OPT_B_1	{Spurn direction and explore freely}
ALL_BEACON_OPT_C_1	{N.B. THIS OPTION IS TO BE REMOVED}
ALL_BEACON_RES_A_1	{I feel suffused with the warm glow of approval. I was lost, but now am found. The Atlas acknowledges my allegiance, and I feel certain that it will manifest itself again soon.}
ALL_BEACON_RES_B_1	{The red orb swells in size, until I can see nothing but crimson. Am I to be smited by a god? Then, in a heartbeat, it is gone. I see only debris again. I am alone.}
ALL_BEACON_RES_C_1	{N.B. THIS OPTION IS TO BE REMOVED}
TRA_ANTI_DESC_1	{The small, shiny-eyed creature is the only inhabitant of the building. We do not share a tongue, but it is evident that my companion would prefer not to be here. As before, it relays a message to me, once again sent by whoever Nada and Polo are.

I can't help but feel that countless analytical systems are recording and studying every move I make.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_3	{The lights in the electronic lifeform's mask casing seem to constrict.
 
They tilt their head slightly as they chitters at me, perhaps wondering what it is that I want.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_4	{The electronic lifeform looks at my biological frame with something approaching pity. Not for the first time, I wonder what lies beneath the entity's mask.
 
Perhaps, long ago, this species was not so different from my own...}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_5	{The lights in the electronic lifeform's casing start to brighten. They jerk their head sharply to the right, a strange buzzing noise signalling an on-rush of unseen data.
 
The download over, they downgrade their communication channels to those of conventional speech...}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_6	{The lights in the lifeform's casing are wide and dim, but as they turn to talk their mask becomes momentarily blank. They swiftly come back online, but I can't help but feel that their piercing gaze is that of a different entity altogether.
 
Nonetheless, they seem keen to communicate.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_7	{A multitude of processes appear to be working within the electronic lifeform. There's one however, a very simple and inelegant one, that's devoted to conversing with creatures of low intelligence.
 
Right now, a fraction of that process seems to be directed at me.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_8	{The casing lights in the electronic lifeform's mask shine brightly. As they lean towards me, a bright flash burns into my retinas.
 
As the after-image subsides, the entity makes it clear that they are ready to converse with me.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_9	{The electronic lifeform speaks slowly, calmly and considerately. Their casing lights flash.
 
Despite their vast intellect, they clearly haven't been able to predict what I want from them...}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_10	{My presence has made the lifeform somewhat curious. They buzz faintly to indicate that they are open to non-electronic communication.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_11	{I feel the bright piercing gaze of the electronic lifeform. They seem extremely interested in what I have to say.}
EXP_REQUEST_DESC_12	{The lights in the electronic lifeform's casing start to brighten. They jerk their head sharply to the right, a strange buzzing noise signalling an on-rush of unseen data.
 
The download over, they downgrade their communication channels to those of conventional speech...}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_1	{The warrior's hackles rise, and they start to shake in anticipation of my request.

I sense that their ancestors are likely to be offended if I push the issue too far...}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_2	{The warrior's movements indicate that their ancestors are not currently insulted.
 
They make friendly barking noises.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_3	{The warrior seems less aggressive than I might expect.
 
Their lips curl over their teeth as they taste my scent.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_4	{The warrior indicates that they have no current desire to kill me.
 
Their lips curl over their teeth a they deliver a series of elegantly formed barking noises.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_5	{The warrior is making snarling noises that sound strangely upbeat.
 
They do not seem intent on violence. Right now.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_6	{The warrior's barks have a welcoming tone. My exosuit's auditory sensors automatically turn down the relay volume.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_7	{The lifeform seems open to conversation, and their ancestors are currently not offended by my presence or the opinions I hold.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_8	{The warrior stares at me, as if in anticipation of a grave insult to their ancestry.
 
I'm about to back away when their face turns. They deliver a sequence of amused yelps at my hesitation, before indicating that they are open to further conversation.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_9	{The warrior shivers in anticipation before confronting me. They bark savagely, showing yellowed canines and a bloodied tongue.
 
As soon as the fury begins, however, it seems to be over. The lifeform nods solemnly, and indicates that they will hear my plea.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_10	{The warrior looks as if they could glory in their ancestry at any given moment.
 
Before they do so, however, they makes it clear that they are also willing to talk to me.}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_11	{The warrior looks as if they might want something dead. Thankfully, right now, it doesn't feel like that's me...}
WAR_REQUEST_DESC_12	{The warrior seems less aggressive than I might expect.
 
Their lips curl over their teeth as they taste my scent.}

NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_1	{My Builder is at their station, poring over some arcane project of their own. I am delighted they joined my team. Their enthusiasm is infectious, and they have a wealth of ideas for the expansion of this base. But before we make a start on construction, they insist on improving my navigational capabilities.

<TECHNOLOGY>Beacons<> can be built using <IMG>BUILD_MENU<> and recoloured to remind you of a particular location.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_1	{I'll provide the blueprints for any construction item you need, but before you start running around the galaxy in search of resources, allow me to present you with this <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> blueprint. Build a <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> to mark your location and you will be able to return there with ease.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_1	{Thank you}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_1	{You're welcome. We wouldn't achieve much if you got yourself lost and left me stranded here.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_2	{Already, I have felt the benefits of having help on hand, but there are limits to what my Builder can achieve on their own. I have asked them to prepare the blueprints for a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>. The all-round knowledge a Scientist could bring would open up enormous possibilities.

In return, I am tasked with finding a supply of <SPECIAL>Spadonium<>, an element used in the delicate diagnostic circuitry of the new work station.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_2	{The <SPECIAL>Spadonium<> I need to calibrate a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal's<> diagnostic sensors is extracted from cacti that live in barren environments. Provide me with some, and I'll have this place ready for a Scientist in no time.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_2	{Here's your Spadonium}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_2	{Excellent. I shall look forward to having more company. I cannot abide solitude.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_2	{I'll come back with the resources you need}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_2	{Remember. Barren biomes. When you have the Spadonium, the plans will be waiting.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_3	{A growing base needs good inventory storage. I ask my Builder to provide a design, but instead they offer me a short cut. If I travel to an abandoned building nearby, I should be able to salvage the plans for a suitable <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<> module.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_3	{I need you to make your way to a nearby abandoned building. When you reach the abandoned terminal, upload its schematics to me. With a <TECHNOLOGY>Storage Container<>, you'll have more space to store items.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_3	{I will investigate}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_3	{Excellent. I've added the coordinates to your map.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_4	{Though they never complain, I know my Builder would enjoy a larger team to work with. They have made it quite clear that they prefer company.

When I raise the issue, my suspicions are confirmed. My Builder suggests recruiting an Armourer, and sets about preparing the design for a <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>. But the base's generators are stretched even now, so expansion will mean finding a reliable alternative power source. Perhaps a <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cell<> would do.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_4	{There's no need to build a giant generator when individual batteries will meet all of our requirements. Ask a Scientist about <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cells<>. They're compact, portable, and powerful. Bring one to me and I'll incorporate it into the <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal's<> design.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_4	{Here's a Voltaic Cell for you}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_4	{Wonderful. Now you can run as many terminals as you need without blowing a fuse.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_4	{I'll come back when I have one}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_4	{Don't keep me waiting. Remember - talk to a Scientist.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_5	{I am keen to inject a little variety into the architecture of my new home. My Builder is happy to draw up the blueprints for more building parts, but they also suggest an ingenious short cut.

The drones that patrol the skies contain <SPECIAL>Pugneum<>, an element with the strange property of being able to hold digital information. If I can salvage a sample from a downed drone, my Builder can extract the plans for every building part the drone has ever scanned.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_5	{To develop more building modules I need more data. In essence, a chip of <SPECIAL>Pugneum<> is nature's hard drive. Find me a destroyed drone, or take one down yourself, if you have the nerve.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_5	{Here's your Pugneum}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_5	{Thank you. These blueprints will broaden your architectural horizons considerably.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_5	{I'll return later with a sample of Pugneum}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_5	{Please do. You'll save me so much time for more interesting projects.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_6	{As I survey my home, I think of the countless pioneers who have come before, forging their future with weapon and plough. Weapons I have, but perhaps it is time to turn the land to better use.

I ask my Builder what we would need for a Farmer to join us here, and learn that the plans for an <TECHNOLOGY>Agricultural Terminal<> are already underway. My Builder believes the perfect solution lies in studying what has come before, and I am tasked with the delivery of <COMMODITY>Gek Charms<> that will assist them with their plans.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_6	{The Gek were fine farmers even before they built their lost empire. Find me <COMMODITY>Gek Charms<> and I will examine their carvings for useful advice.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_6	{I have the artefact you asked for}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_6	{Excellent. This blueprint is tailor made for a Farmer. Have you given thought to where you'll find one?}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_6	{I'll be back later}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_6	{You're the boss. When you're ready, I'll be here.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_7	{As the base expands, the list of resources I need grows ever longer, but of all the requests made by my Builder, this latest is the strangest. When I asked about the possibility of making some decorative decals to brighten up our accommodation, they insisted the designs would require an adhesive made from <SPECIAL>Mordite<>.

The collection of this foul substance, naturally, falls to me.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_7	{<SPECIAL>Mordite<> crystals form in the decomposing bodies of dead creatures. I don't know why you look so revolted. Your species are meat eaters, are you not?}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_7	{Here is the Mordite you wanted}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_7	{Leave it there for me. I'm not handling that stuff with bare hands.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_7	{I'll be back when I have what you need}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_7	{In the meantime, I'll draw up some decal designs for you to choose from.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_8	{I have tasked my Builder with devising a means to reduce the coming and going that fills my day. They have suggested an <TECHNOLOGY>Autonomous Mining Unit<>; a machine that can extract the planet's resources without the need for constant supervision. Unfortunately, they are short of suitable <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for the prototype.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_8	{An <TECHNOLOGY>Autonomous Mining Unit<> will do the hard work while you're away, but that's just the start of my plans for you. I need <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for all manner of devices. You'd better pay a visit to the <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_8	{I've got your Circuit Board}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_8	{Perfect. Here are the blueprints for your AMU.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_8	{I'll come back when I have one}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_8	{Don't keep me waiting. Remember - talk to a Scientist.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_9	{At the Construction Terminal, I am ambushed by my Builder, who asks that I consider building a <TECHNOLOGY>Landing Pad<> for the base. Something to do with 'keeping up appearances', they tell me, though quite who they are trying to impress, I do not know.

Perhaps it is a quirk of their race's culture, but my builder insists that any base with many rooms simply must have a landing pad.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_9	{Every dwelling of a certain size must have a <TECHNOLOGY>Landing Pad<>. It is vital that we are always ready to accept guests. Do we have the rooms yet?}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_9	{Yes, we have the rooms}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_9	{Marvellous. Here are the blueprints. I will prepare for visitors... just in case.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_9	{No, I haven't built enough}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_9	{Well don't just stand there. Get building.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_10	{My Builder is keen to establish a line of trade between our humble outpost and the wider galaxy. We have been generating a surplus of resources that could be sold for profit.

As luck would have it, the solution falls well within their realm of expertise. They offer the blueprints for a <TECHNOLOGY>Galactic Trade Terminal<>, and ask only that I find a supply of <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<> suitable for the new terminal's circuitry.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_10	{Access to the Galactic Trade Network requires only the appropriate Terminal, but if those things overheat while you're trading you can lose millions. Go see a Scientist. They know how to make the <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<> I need.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_10	{I've got all the gel you need}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_10	{Wonderful. A universe of mercantile opportunity awaits. The Gek would be proud of you.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_B_10	{I'll come back another time}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_B_10	{Be sure you do. This could be a highly profitable venture.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_DESC_11	{My builder has kindly offered me a gift containing a number of new building module blueprints.

The blueprints include a <TECHNOLOGY>Glass Cuboid Room<>, a <TECHNOLOGY>Holo-Door<> and decorative <TECHNOLOGY>Coloured Lights<> that should help further improve the base.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_LANG_11	{Hello friend, after all the help you've given me with my research I wanted to show you my appreciation. Here are some blueprints for more building modules, I think they will make the place look great.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_OPT_A_11	{Thanks}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RES_A_11	{You're welcome. I hope that these blueprints will further broaden your architectural capabilities.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_WAIT_DESC_1	{My Builder is engrossed in their plans. Clearly, this is an ill-timed visit. They mutter to me without looking up from their station.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_WAIT_LANG_1	{Busy. Busy. Focus is paramount. Come back later}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_WAIT_OPT_A_1	{Please excuse the interruption}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_WAIT_RES_A_1	{Of course. Come back when I've cracked this puzzle.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RECR_DESC_1	{The being grabs my hand and shakes it vigorously as I approach them. Their wide-set eyes fix me with a friendly gaze and I am not surprised when they speak to me in my own language.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RECR_LANG_1	{My good friend what luck for both of us. I am a specialist in construction, in search of a new position. Have you established a planetary base? If so, give me a terminal to work at and I'll build you the foundations of an empire.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RECR_OPT_A_1	{Recruit Overseer}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RECR_RES_A_1	{You will not regret our association. I have the coordinates of your planetary base. I'll meet you there... what is the word... oh yes. Boss.}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RECR_OPT_B_1	{There are preparations I must attend to before I can hire a Builder}
NPC_HIRE_BUILDER_RECR_RES_B_1	{Very well. A base and a Construction Terminal is what I'll need to begin work.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_1	{The new recruit seems well acquainted with the Agricultural Terminal as they bring the device to life my senses are flooded with a strange scent and I find myself infected by my new assistant's zeal.

They are eager to begin farming the land, and have brought seeds ready to sow. Our first crop will be <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<>, useful for the <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> it produces. Additionally we will need a <TECHNOLOGY>Hydroponics Tray<> to plant them in.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_1	{A fresh supply of <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> is vital for many formulae. And with the toxins boiled out, it can add a real kick to your cooking, too. Remember to plant the <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<> indoors to ensure a successful crop. You'll need these <TECHNOLOGY>Hydroponics Trays<> to plant inside. Shall we get this farm started?}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_1	{Accept Bloodsbane}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_1	{I'm not the only one with 'green fingers', eh? The fruits of your labour will soon swell our stores.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_2	{My Farmer assures me that a great variety of plants can be encouraged to grow here. Some, however, have hidden dangers.

My crop of <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<> is a good example. One drop of its pungent sap could leave me temporarily paralysed. The solution is technical; I must ask an Armourer to help me build a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> before attempting to handle any more hazardous materials.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_2	{The <SPECIAL>Venom Sacs<> in <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<> will quickly burn through your gloves and into your veins. Build a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> if you want to handle hazardous plants without harm. The design is well within the ability of any specialist Armourer.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_2	{I've already built a Haz-Mat Gauntlet}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_2	{A wise decision. Here. Try this Gravitino Orb crop when you have time. With your gauntlet, you can handle any of the exotic plants.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_2	{I'm not ready to build that}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_2	{Well don't wait too long or your Armourer will be drawing up the blueprints for a mausoleum.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_3	{My Farmer has an idea that could make us rich. They have suggested that we grow a crop of <SPECIAL>Albumen Pearl Orbs<>, and are already planning to spend the units we'd make on new equipment. It amuses me that farming, the humblest of pursuits, can still sometimes yield the greatest rewards.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_3	{My scans reveal the remnants of an ancient settlement where <SPECIAL>Albumen Pearls<> were once grown. Visit the ruins to see if some seed fragments remain.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_3	{Can you mark the ruins on my map?}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_3	{Yes. I've pinpointed the spot where Albumen Pearls were once harvested. Good luck with your search.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_4	{I am not given to questioning the expertise of my assistants, but my Farmer's latest request stretches my credulity.

In order to perfect their latest cultivar, I have been tasked with gathering a sample of <SPECIAL>Coprite<>, taken from the faecal matter of overfed wildlife.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_4	{The useful <SPECIAL>Mordite<> crystals that form when some creatures decompose can be cultivated in a local tuber called <TRADEABLE>Carrion Root<> this will be our reward. However unfortunately for you, <SPECIAL>Coprite<> is the only substance that will encourage my seedlings to grow. It forms in the droppings of animals that have been overfed.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_4	{Here's your Coprite}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_4	{Thank you. Do remember to wash your hands.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_4	{I'll return when I have your sample}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_4	{Thanks. I'm sorry to ask, but someone has to do it.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_5	{After the last foul task my Farmer devised for me, I am almost nervous to approach them. And perhaps with good cause. Their experiments with Coprite continue.

At least the foul smelling stuff is proving useful. My Farmer plans to use it in the creation of a new crop, and I am tasked with planting the <TRADEABLE>Gravitino Orbs<> that will be fused with the already provided Coprite to create a <TRADEABLE>Coprite Orb<> plant.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_5	{Coprite can be added to the DNA sequence of <TRADEABLE>Gravitino Orbs<> to produce a versatile new plant. Have you any growing on your farm already?}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_5	{Yes, we are growing Gravitino Orbs}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_5	{Wonderful. Don't worry about the new plant's odour. The smell of Coprite is neutralised by the Gravitino Orbs.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_5	{No. We are not growing Gravitino Orbs}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_5	{Okay. Remember that need to set them growing before I can finish this work.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_6	{With careful adjustment to their genetic code, my Farmer has been able to encourage crops from every conceivable habitat to grow on our farm.

Lately, they have turned their attention to fungi, which they hope will provide spores for the <TRADEABLE>Puffball<>. In order to modify the plants for cultivation, however, I have been asked to provide a sample of <SPECIAL>Rigogen<> from the leaves of an underwater plant.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_6	{I have all but finished the adaptations to this <TRADEABLE>Puffball<> mushroom's DNA sequence. Once I introduce <SPECIAL>Rigogen<>, the new cultivar will be ready to grow. Can you help?}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_6	{Here's the Rigogen you asked for}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_6	{Excellent. Future harvests will reward your inconvenience.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_6	{I'll come back when I have it}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_6	{I'll be waiting. Remember you'll find what we need underwater.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_7	{My Farmer's knowledge of agricultural crops is encyclopaedic. It seems there is no corner of this or any world that does not prompt some fresh suggestion from them.

They have set their sights on growing Skywort, a flowering whose crystalline blooms can be ground to form a fine, durable glass. Fused with Antrium, it should survive transplantation from the frigid climate in which it is found.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_7	{<TRADEABLE>Skywort<> is the crowning glory of any farm and has many uses. Growing it is relatively easy, but to transplant it from its snowy home, I will need <SPECIAL>Antrium<>, a luminous substance common to cave plants.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_7	{I have the Antrium you need}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_7	{You won't regret it. Skywort can be processed to produce a fine, strong glass.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_7	{I will return when I have the resources}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_7	{See that you do. I must have that Antrium before I can make progress.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_8	{My Farmer has a talent for planting complementary crops. One plant's excretions provide the nutrients for another.

When I enquire about their studies, my assistant beseeches me to lend a hand with their work. By sowing naturally radioactive <TRADEABLE>Carrion Root<>, we can encourage the more delicate crop <TRADEABLE>Dictotyl<> to grow.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_8	{I have prepared a tray of <TRADEABLE>Dicotyl<> seedlings. These small flowers usually require high levels of radiation to thrive, but by first sowing <TRADEABLE>Carrion Root<>, we can feed the <TRADEABLE>Dicotyl<> with radiation from the root's Mordite crystals.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_8	{I have planted some Carrion Root}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_8	{Once again, you have saved me from the dirty work. Thank you.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_8	{I'll talk to you again once I've planted Carrion Root}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_8	{Good. Remember to wear your Haz-Mat Gauntlet when you're handling that stuff.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_9	{My Farmer has expressed a keen interest in succulents, but plants accustomed to the barren lands in which cacti thrive must be grown indoors. <COMMODITY>Glass<> will be needed for seed trays that will be used to encourage the <TRADEABLE>Cucrassula<> seedlings to grow.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_9	{I am confident that <TRADEABLE>Cucrassula<> would grow well. But the seedlings must be started under <COMMODITY>Glass<>. If you don't have any, a Scientist will provide a solution.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_9	{I have the Glass you need}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_9	{My most sincere thanks. Baked Cucrassula is a personal favourite of mine.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_9	{I will need to find some Glass before I can help}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_9	{Like I said, ask a Scientist.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_10	{My Farmer's interest in fauna extremophiles grows. They have presented me with a sample of <TRADEABLE>Vivilava<> - a strange living rock that grows in extreme heat. I am charged with fetching a mineral called <SPECIAL>Viridium<> to feed its delicate root system.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_10	{I hope my request will not send you too far afield. The <SPECIAL>Viridium<> I need is found only within mineral deposits found in the terrain of Green star systems.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_10	{I have the Viridium you need}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_10	{That's good news. I appreciate that not all of my requests are easily answered.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_B_10	{I'll return with your Viridium when I can}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_B_10	{I hope you don't have too far to travel.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_DESC_11	{My Gek assistant is nibbling on a baked Cucrassula as I approach. I decline the portion they offer politely, hoping my refusal will not cause offence.

I need not have worried. My Farmers is more than happy to keep it for himself.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_LANG_11	{Suit yourself. They are our finest crop. Indeed, with the farm thriving like it is, I don't think there's anything else I can teach you.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_OPT_A_11	{Okay. Thanks for all of your help}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RES_A_11	{You're welcome. Thanks for the Cucrassula. You don't know what you're missing.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_WAIT_DESC_1	{My Farmer is enjoying a brief rest. Their day is long, and I do not want to rob them of these quiet moments.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_WAIT_LANG_1	{Your patience is appreciated. I promise I will be back on my feet soon.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_WAIT_OPT_A_1	{I'll leave you in peace}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_WAIT_RES_A_1	{Please come back later. A short rest is all I need.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RECR_DESC_1	{I am confronted by a being who is eager to make a good impression on me. They are a farmer, and looking for employment.

I consider the offer carefully. A farm is a reliable source of tradable goods. Once established, it could increase my spending power considerably.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RECR_LANG_1	{No one will serve your farming needs better than I, I assure you. Do you have a planetary base? Provide a Terminal for me there and my services are yours.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RECR_OPT_A_1	{I could do with a Farmer. You're hired}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RECR_RES_A_1	{A sound decision. I will gather my belongings and meet you on your land.}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RECR_OPT_B_1	{Sorry, I'm not hiring at the moment}
NPC_HIRE_FARMER_RECR_RES_B_1	{If you change your mind, I'll be here. Unless I've been snapped up by someone with more foresight.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_1	{My Armourer has a more holistic approach to their plans than I expected. When I enquire about new weapons, they suggest that we start by improving my capacity to gather resources. I am offered the blueprints for a new exosuit adaptation; a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> capable of handling radioactive and toxic materials that would otherwise be harmful.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_1	{Weapons can wait. You'll need this <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> for handling hazardous fauna. Or would you like to be remembered for being defeated by a plant?}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_1	{Thank you}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_1	{It's a start. We will make a warrior of you yet.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_2	{Negotiating employee relations with a weapons specialist is a delicate task, and my Armourer's brusque manner does not help.

I must take care not to offend them. They have the means to register their displeasure most violently. The <TECHNOLOGY>Plasma Torpedos<> they have prepared for my ship are a case in point. Once their guidance systems have been calibrated with the <SPECIAL>Gravitino Ball<> by Armourer has requested, they will be a formidable weapon indeed.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_2	{The path of life is strewn with the corpses of the unprepared.

I can offer you additional protection for your ship, but these <TECHNOLOGY>Plasma Torpedos<> require <SPECIAL>Gravitino Balls<> for their guidance systems. Have you been farming <SPECIAL>Gravitino Orbs<>?}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_2	{I have a Gravitino Ball already}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_2	{Well hand it over. One must always be ready to fight.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_B_2	{I'll be back when I have what you need}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_B_2	{See that you return swiftly. Patience is not my strong point.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_3	{Before they turn their attention to my ship's weapon systems, my Armourer demands that I add one further tool to my kit; an <TECHNOLOGY>Advanced Mining Laser<>, to aid in gathering the resources that our munitions will require.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_3	{You can't extract the minerals I require for your arsenal with that basic laser of yours. My latest scan revealed unauthorised mining underway close by. If I were you I'd find the trespasser and confiscate their technology so we can copy its circuitry.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_3	{Please mark the miner on my map}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_3	{Done. They may not be built as weapons but advanced lasers pack some serious power. Bear that in mind if your trespasser behaves aggressively.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_4	{Here, on my new home world, I feel secure. But the lawless space that surrounds us weighs heavily on my mind.

I have tasked my Armourer with providing new weapons systems for my ship. Their solution is a <TECHNOLOGY>Photon Blast<> weapon, based on Vy'keen technology, but to finalise the design they will need to consult <TRADEABLE>Vy'keen Daggers<>.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_4	{Your ship must be ready for close combat. The Vy'keen have a powerful <TECHNOLOGY>Photon Blast<> weapon I could adapt. Seek out their <TRADEABLE>Vy'keen Daggers<> for clues to the design.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_4	{I have the Vy'keen Dagger you asked for}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_4	{The blueprint is yours. Take care that it does not fall into hostile hands.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_B_4	{I'll be back when I have the Vy'keen Dagger}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_B_4	{Do not delay. Without improved weapons, we remain vulnerable to attack.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_5	{My Armourer is warming to their purpose at last. I am promised the designs for a formidable rapid-fire weapon. But while they finalise their plans for a <TECHNOLOGY>Photon Accelerator<> weapons upgrade, I must undertake an urgent errand for them.

Their work has exposed them to poisonous toxins which only the element <SPECIAL>Coryzagen<> can counteract. Fortunately, there is a source available to us on frozen planets.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_5	{My experiments have brought me into contact with toxic minerals. A tea made from <SPECIAL>Coryzagen<> which can be extracted from <TRADEABLE>Skywort<> will counter the exposure. If you are not farming it, look in the snow.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_5	{Here. Take this Coryzagen}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_5	{Not a moment too soon. This will soon flush the toxins from my body. I hope this weapon is worth my headache.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_B_5	{I'm sorry. I'll return soon with Coryzagen for you}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_B_5	{Be sure that you do. Wait too long and you may be too late to help.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_6	{My Armourer is muttering over their terminal as I approach. Apparently, they have reached some impasse in their latest project; an upgrade to the <TECHNOLOGY>Ion Blast<> weapon for my Starship.

They reject my offer to help, insisting that only the specialist assistance of a Scientist will prevent these problems in future.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_6	{I can only do so much. This places needs the support of a dedicated Scientist if I am to make further progress, and unless you build a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<> you will never be able to recruit one.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_6	{I've built the terminal you requested}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_6	{Good. I managed to complete my blueprints this time, but with a Scientist on board we'll save a lot of time.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_B_6	{I'm not going to build that right now}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_B_6	{Suit yourself, but until you build that terminal, you won't be seeing new weapons from me.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_DESC_11	{The sad news my Armourer imparts comes as no surprise. They have transformed my ship in the time we have worked together, but now our working relationship has been exhausted.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_LANG_11	{There is nothing more I can teach you. Not without breaking several interplanetary arms treaties, at least.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_OPT_A_11	{You have my gratitude}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RES_A_11	{And you mine. Choose your battles wisely.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_WAIT_DESC_1	{My assistant is making repairs to their own blaster. They do not seem to be going well. If I interrupt them in this mood, I may find myself used for target practice.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_WAIT_LANG_1	{Wretched thing. I should give up and strip it for parts.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_WAIT_OPT_A_1	{I can come back later}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_WAIT_RES_A_1	{Lasers. Bah. Give me old fashioned projectiles.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RECR_DESC_1	{This being has the upright demeanor of a warrior. Their sidearm is a custom piece that shows remarkable workmanship.

When they turn to speak, I instinctively reach for my own blaster.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RECR_LANG_1	{Relax. I'm an Armourer, not an assassin. Perhaps you have need of my skills. Do you have a base? Give me a terminal to work at, and I'll build you an arsenal that will shake the heavens.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RECR_OPT_A_1	{You're hired}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RECR_RES_A_1	{A wise decision in this violent age. Let me gather my belongings. I will make my own way to your planet's surface.}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RECR_OPT_B_1	{I'm not looking for an Armourer right now}
NPC_HIRE_WEAPON_RECR_RES_B_1	{So be it. With luck, you will never have cause to regret that decision.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_1	{My Scientist assesses the work station I have provided with a critical eye. I trust nothing has been forgotten. It would be a shame to delay their work.

Their contended muttering suggests that I have done reasonably well. My assumption is confirmed when I am presented with a gift; the blueprints for a <COMMODITY>Voltaic Cell<>.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_1	{The work station is acceptable but my designs will be mere ornament without power. I have devised a powerful portable battery for you. You will need <SPECIAL>Antrium<> to catalyse production of the cell. It can be harvested from plants that grow in caves.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_1	{Accept Voltaic Cell Blueprint}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_1	{Excellent. These Voltaic Cells will power any tech we devise.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_2	{My Scientist's knowledge of the elements is encyclopedic. They pointedly refuse, however, to do their own field work. While they finalise the design of the wiring for our base, I am invited to undertake a short journey on their behalf.

Their scanners have picked up a signal worthy of investigation.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_2	{I'm far too busy to leave my station. There's a signal we need to investigate; a distress call, or part of one, that originates from a nearby Radio Tower. Will you make the journey?}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_2	{Of course}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_2	{Thank you. What hope is there for any of us if we ignore distress signals?}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_3	{The presence of an all-rounder on my team is unlocking many possibilities. Each new discovery leads to another's inspiration.

Their latest innovation is a strong, <COMMODITY>Non-ferrous Plate<> suitable for all manner of technologies, but to refine the design, I must venture into an inhospitable radioactive environment for a supply of <SPECIAL>Candensium<>. Notably I will need a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<>. I should consult an Armourer before handling the plant.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_3	{<COMMODITY> Non-ferrous Plate<> is the foundation of many technologies. Once reinforced with <SPECIAL>Candensium<> from radioactive plants, it will be ideal for your purposes. You can find it in radioactive biomes, but beware you will be need a <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-mat Gauntlet<> to handle the leaves.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_3	{Yes, I have Candensium}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_3	{Perfect. The blueprints are yours.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_3	{No, but I will return with some when I can}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_3	{Very well. Watch your Exosuit's life support levels carefully while you're looking for it.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_4	{While the breadth of their knowledge is useful, it is sometimes difficult to get my Scientist to focus on the task in hand.

I am in dire need of <COMMODITY>Circuit Boards<> for the base's electronics, but they are absorbed in their own studies. If I fulfill their request to gather the <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> they want to examine, perhaps I can get them back on track.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_4	{The work you set me interferes with my taxonomical investigation. I'll draw up the plans for the <COMMODITY>Circuit Board<> you need, but you must provide a sample of <SPECIAL>Sac Venom<> for my collection. You can harvest it from <TRADEABLE>Bloodsbane<>, and is rarely found on planets.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_4	{I have what you need}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_4	{Thanks. You think me eccentric, but there is much to learn from cataloguing nature.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_4	{I'll fetch your Sac Venom and return later}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_4	{Take care to wear your Haz-mat Gauntlet when handling it. Medicine is not my strongest field.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_5	{Without <COMMODITY>Glass<> to grow under, only the hardiest seedlings will survive my Farmer's attempts at cultivation. Fortunately, our little colony relies on teamwork, and my Scientist's ingenuity knows no bounds. Their solution is natural, renewable, and plentiful throughout the galaxy. Skywort.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_5	{The crystalline flowers of Skywort can be processed into <COMMODITY>Glass<> of the highest quality. Build a waypoint <TECHNOLOGY>Beacon<> to aid our fieldwork and I'll draw up the blueprints. If you get lost, all of my hard work will be wasted.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_5	{I've built a Beacon}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_5	{Excellent. It will aid us in future expeditions.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_5	{I haven't built a Beacon yet}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_5	{Are you determined to get lost? When you've rectified the situation, I'll be here.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_6	{At the Science Terminal, my assistant can barely contain their delight. They have made a breakthrough in their search for a tough, synthetic <COMMODITY>Poly-fibre<> for the base's cabling.

Their experiments have depleted their supplies, however, and I am asked if I can provide them with more <COMMODITY>Copper Wire<>.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_6	{My synthetic <COMMODITY>Poly-fibre<> will provide strong, long-lasting cable for all of your needs, but I used up all my <COMMODITY>Copper Wire<> in the prototyping stages. Do you have any to replace my stocks?}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_6	{Yes, I have the Copper Wire you want}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_6	{Thank you. Here. Take the blueprints. Power, data, you name it, this Poly-fibre will do the job.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_6	{Not the moment. I'll be back when I do}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_6	{Thank you. Come back soon. I can make little progress without it.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_7	{Lately, my Scientist has turned their attention to chemistry. The fumes from their latest experiment almost overcome me as I approach their terminal.

They are developing a powerful <COMMODITY>Acid<>, but it requires one more ingredient if it is to be stabilized for use. An element called <SPECIAL>Temerium<>.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_7	{<SPECIAL>Temerium<> is present in the gills of toxic fungi. Its stabilizing properties should counter these fumes. The sooner you provide me with some, the sooner you can stop holding your nose.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_7	{Here's the Temerium you requested}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_7	{You have my thanks. Collaboration is the key to all scientific endeavour.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_7	{I don't have any, but I'll be back when I do}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_7	{Don't be too long. The air in here is getting hard to breathe.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_8	{The fumes hanging over my Scientist's work station are less noxious than before, but their equipment is covered with a thin layer of translucent slime. They have been working on an <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<>, but are unable to complete the formula. Perhaps I can help.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_8	{Ah. You find me at a difficult moment. This <COMMODITY>Insulating Gel<> needs work. I based my formula on a language that is not my own, gleaned from a nearby monolith. Perhaps I missed something. Will you visit the site? Maybe you can find a clue that will resolve the confusion.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_8	{Please mark the Monolith on my map}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_8	{Done. Good luck with your investigation.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_9	{I shall be glad when my Scientist has had their fill of chemistry. I am forced to hold my nose as I inspect their latest project; an advanced engine lubricant.

I am glad when they ask a favour of me that will take me away from their work. And even happier when I learn that the <TRADEABLE>Korvax Convergence Cube<> I'm asked to deliver may hold the key to neutralising the noxious fumes that their experiments produce.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_9	{A good <COMMODITY>Lubricant<> is vital wherever there are moving parts. If you don't like the smell, there may be a solution. The Korvax developed an olfactory blocker that will neutralise any odour. Their <TRADEABLE>Korvax Convergence Cubes<> may hold the key to its manufacture. Then again, you can always hold your nose.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_9	{Here is the Convergence Cube you requested}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_9	{Thank you, but I fear I sent you on a wild goose chase. I found a way to neutralise the smell myself while you were gone.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_9	{I'll return with your Korvax Convergence Cube when I can}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_9	{Thank you. In the meantime I'll keep experimenting.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_10	{I have been warned that my Scientist is experimenting with <COMMODITY>Explosive<> materials today. As I approach, they are cursing in their native tongue.

In an attempt to calm them, I ask if there is anything I can do to help. A supply of <SPECIAL>Rubeum<>, they tell me, would make their work much less dangerous and difficult.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_10	{There is no room for error when working with <COMMODITY>Explosives<> I could stabilise this formula with <SPECIAL>Rubeum<>; an element that occurs only in the rocks of Red star systems. Do you have any? The sooner this job is done, the sooner we can all relax.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_10	{Here's the Rubeum you need}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_10	{And here are the blueprints with my formula for Explosives. They're more stable now, but still dangerous, so take care.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_B_10	{I will find some and bring it to you}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_B_10	{Thank you. If you return to find a hole in the ground, you'll know what has happened.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_DESC_11	{The Science Terminal is unusually quiet as I approach. My Scientist shakes their head as they scroll through their notes on-screen.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_LANG_11	{There is more I could teach you, but not without years of study on your part. For now, I'm afraid, our partnership has exhausted its potential.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_OPT_A_11	{Your work has been vital. Thank you}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RES_A_11	{You're most welcome. Knowledge is its own reward.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_WAIT_DESC_1	{My Scientist has many talents, but diplomacy is not one of them. They could learn much from my Builder, with whom they share lodgings.}

NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_WAIT_OPT_A_1	{I'll come back later}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_WAIT_RES_A_1	{If you must.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RECR_DESC_1	{One being piques my interest. They are tapping their fingers together absent-mindedly and reciting the details of some complex chemical formula.

I do not mean to interrupt, but my presence disturbs their train of thought and they speak first, in my own tongue.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RECR_LANG_1	{You seem surprised that I know your language. I have many talents, though I am a Scientist first; a multi-disciplinarian, and an innovator. I also happen to lack employment at the moment. If you have a planetary base, and a terminal for me to work at, I will gladly join your team.}
NPC_HIRE_SCIENTIST_RECR_OPT_A_1	{You're hired}

They have calmed since I last saw them, though I still feel a sense of dread within their eyes, of the paranoia that has sustained them across the stars. I do not know what I feel. I do not know whether I have made a mistake. But there is nothing to be done. The Vy'keen has honoured their word; I will honour mine.}

NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_2	{‘Grah! You are a pathetic child, no better than a Gek! Leave me and do as I require, lest I strike you down where you stand!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_3	{The technician requires me to construct an <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<>. First we must gather intelligence regarding our surroundings; weapons will come later.

The more time I spend with this creature, the less they remind me of the other Vy'keen I have encountered. Although the threats are still there, there is a passion within them for more than just killing. 

Who can say what life it might have lived? What life I might have lived, if I was not born to explore these worlds?}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_3	{Once we have the <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<>, we can map this planet. Traveller, know that my race were once more than just warriors; we were explorers, defenders of these worlds. Before the Sentinels. Before Hirk and his great folly...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_3	{I've built the Exocraft Signal Booster.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_3	{‘Good. Here are the weapon blueprints as promised; for what we must do, we must prepare for every eventuality...’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_3	{I'm not ready yet.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_3	{‘It is for this that my people shall exterminate me, and you can only blather?! Grah! To work! To work, interloper!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_4	{The technician requires me to use my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<> to locate a depot and steal the <SPECIAL>Armadium<> from within; it will use this substance to create an <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Acceleration Module.<>

The Vy’keen possesses an unusual obsession with those I have come to know as Sentinels. I have seen them looking over ancient scripts in the Vy'keen language, muttering various names – Obinqiul. Aeron. Atlas... Is this why its people pursue it? What secret has it discovered? What heresy has it committed?}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_4	{I -- I have detected Sentinel depots on this world! Use your <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<> to track one down, Traveller; destroy the depot and bring me back its precious <SPECIAL>Armadium<> for use in my work. I will construct an <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Acceleration Module<> for future expeditions...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_4	{I have the Armadium you require.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_4	{The technician takes the substance from me, using it as the basis for an Exocraft Acceleration Module. Satisfied, they give me the blueprint without another word.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_4	{I'm not ready yet.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_4	{‘Interloper, do not tarry; our lives are short, our meaning fleeting. Yours will be even shorter if you do not finish my task! Grah!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_5	{The technician requires me to use my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Acceleration Module<> to reach a terminal quickly enough to receive an encrypted transmission; they believe we will also be able to remove an <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Mining Laser<> blueprint from the Vy’keen network. 

They are frenzied at my approach, excited. Whatever this transmission might contain, whatever system it has been sent from, it would seem to matter a great deal to the Vy’keen.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_5	{I left my consort and spawn behind on my homeworld, Traveller; I must know what happened to them, I must shed the last vestiges of my attachment... You will use the <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Acceleration Module<> to reach their encrypted transmission before its deletion; in the process, we can pull Vy’keen Mining Laser technology from the network. Grhah! We will kill two Gek with one blast!}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_5	{OK, open the network; I’ll speed there now.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_5	{‘Be vigilant, be quick: I require this message. I must know what happened to those I left behind!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_5	{I can't do this yet.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_5	{‘Traveller, do this thing for me and I shall be bonded to you in trust.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_5_F	{The technician waits, fidgeting, nervous. I have not yet recovered the encrypted transmission they asked for. They stress that time is of the essence, urging me to proceed to the marked location at once.

This will be the technician's final chance to hear from their family before they purge themselves of such attachments.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_5_F	{Grah! I need that transmission, interloper! The signal can only loop through the network so many times. Go and receive the transmission before it's too late!}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_5_F	{OK, open the network again; I’ll speed there now.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_5_F	{‘Be vigilant, be quick: I require this message. I must know what happened to those I left behind!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_5_F	{I can't do this now.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_5_F	{‘Traveller, why did you accept if you cannot do this now? You place us all in great jeopardy!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_5_S	{LOADING TRANSMISSION... DECRYPTING SUB-SPACE FREQUENCY... ERROR. INTERCEPTION.

Witness the price of your heresy, fugitive of the Vy’keen. 

Know that there is no sky in which we cannot find you, no system to which you might flee unscathed.

Hide, then, in the depths of this galaxy. For we are patient. 

Know that your spawn wept like mewling Gek as we cut them down. That we killed your consort as it fled, leaving the others behind to suffer. Where shall you ever find peace, knowing these things?}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_5_S	{The terminal whirs into action, but the message is not what I expected. The technician told me to retrieve a transmission from their family, but this...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_5_S	{End the transmission.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_5_S	{I must return and decide what to do. Before the transmission closes, I manage to pull the Exocraft Mining Laser blueprint from the network.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_6	{The technician tells me they are going to clean their mind to prepare for their holy task. Before they remove all other thoughts, they wish to know what happened to their family. 

They were expecting to intercept a message from their consort and spawn, but instead... instead I discovered that their family had been killed, murdered by other Vy'keen in retaliation for their heresy.

As they stand before me, expectant, nervous, I do not know whether to tell the truth.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_6	{My preparations are almost complete. Soon I will purge myself of my old life, of my old attachments, to commit fully to what I must become. But... even if I will remember nothing, I must know... I must know, Traveller! Tell me what my consort said! Tell me of my spawn! Please, I have waited so long...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_6	{TRUTH: They are dead. I'm sorry...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_6	{‘I... I -- Leave me, Traveller. We Vy'keen prepare for death our whole lives, but this... Who I am now will die with them, lost in the obliteration of time and memory. Thank you, friend, for what you have done. When we next speak I will be reborn.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_6	{LIE: They're OK. They're happy.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_6	{‘Grah! Your pathetic interpretation -- we Vy'keen are never happy. We are proud of our strife. But... I am satisfied to hear of this. I think -- I think I can do what I must do, now. Thank you, friend, for giving me this hope as I fade. When we next speak I will be reborn.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_7	{The technician asks me to build an <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Mining Laser<>, promising to craft me the blueprint for a new Exocraft, the Nomad.

Their face is different, beneath the eyes, beneath the soul. They have changed irrevocably. Where once they would insult me with meaningless threats, now they speak only of a singular purpose. Where once they would be capable of happiness or grief, now they only care about their cult, about their supposed purpose...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_7	{I am -- I am reborn without attachment. I can focus now, focus on what I must do... Grah! You will require a Mining Laser in the days to come. Build it and I will craft you a Nomad Exocraft befitting an acolyte of Nal.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_7	{I have built the Exocraft Mining Laser.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_7	{‘Take the Nomad blueprint, Traveller, and become an Acolyte of Nal!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_7	{Before I do, what is Nal?}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_7	{‘Nal, the progenitor! Nal, who opposed the madness of Hirk! Nal, who shall be avenged!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_8	{The technician needs me to gather <SPECIAL>Detritum<>, a hyper-dense mineral that can only be extracted with the <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Mining Laser<>. Detritum can be gathered from large rocks across this planet. The technician will be able to use this substance to craft an upgrade for my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster.<>

The Vy'keen stares at me, evaluating my every movement. They make me uneasy. Whatever they have been trying to do, it will happen soon. That waiting, that not knowing... it fills me with a strange dread.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_8	{Your <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Mining Laser<> should be powerful enough to extract even <SPECIAL>Detritum<> from this planet. Witness the art of the Mech-Priest, that I can create such marvels! Grah!

This universe is a mystery, Traveller. Lives are spent in solving it. We shall do our part.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_8	{I have the Detritum you need.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_8	{The technician takes the substance from me, and uses it to craft the new Exocraft Signal Booster blueprint.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_8	{I haven't accumulated enough Detritum.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_8	{‘Then why do we still speak? Grah! Attend to my order at once.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_9	{The <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<> blueprint holds great promise; I have already discovered so much with the technician's aid, and even now they forge upgrades to my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft's weapon system<>.

Yet I cannot help but miss the way they were before, for all their new-found efficiency and focus. The flaw of their individuality, forever gone, drowned within their great purpose. I wonder if I will ever lose myself in this way. If I will become the thing I hate.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_9	{I have been analysing your Exocraft telemetry. It seems that my previous incarnation did not even provide you with the most basic in <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft weapon upgrades<>. Grah! Forgive the Vy'keen that I was, acolyte.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_9	{I've built the Exocraft Signal Booster upgrade.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_9	{‘Here are your blueprints. I will -- wait! -- I'm detecting something... This -- this cannot be...’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_9	{I haven't built the upgrade yet.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_9	{‘You are a diligent acolyte, Traveller. Do not disappoint me.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_10	{The technician requires <SPECIAL>Nanite Clusters<> to create an upgrade for my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Acceleration Module<>. They suggest I might uncover some in abandoned structures.

The Vy'keen claims that this Nal, this namesake of their cult, once visited my planet. I cannot know if this is true. I walk through worlds of ruin and wonder at these peoples, at their obsession with their past, at the hatred that tore them asunder. I wonder what the future might hold, what secrets might echo out through the hub of creation.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_10	{That you chose this world, of all worlds, to make your home, out of infinite possibilities... I did not think it possible, but my scans have uncovered the truth: Nal itself visited this place. We shall uncover its final words. Use your upgraded <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<> to locate this planet's abandoned structures. Bring me the Nanite Clusters contained within, and I will use them to forge a new Acceleration Module for the trials ahead.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_10	{I have the Nanite Clusters.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_10	{‘Yes - yes! Take this Exocraft Acceleration Module blueprint and prepare, traveller.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_10	{I don't have the substance you require.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_10	{‘You will soon, Traveller. I have faith in you.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_11	{A Monolith has been activated; if I reach it quickly enough, I will gain the forbidden knowledge of Nal.

The technician served their holy purpose, driven to obliterate their own personality in pursuit of this very day, this very moment. I do not know if their sacrifice will be in vain.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_11	{Traveller, my work is complete. I have overridden the leylines, charged their holy data; they have revealed to me a Monolith, a tomb for the final prophecy! Go, Traveller! Go and claim its secret!}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_11	{OK, charge the leyline; I’ll speed there now.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_11	{‘I envy you, Traveller! To see the words of Nal itself! Grah!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_11	{Not yet, I’ll go soon.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_11	{‘You know not how important this is, how many of my people would kill us where we stood for even mentioning Nal's name...’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_11_F	{The technician awaits the word of the Monolith, telling me that I must reach it quickly in order to activate its testament.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_11_F	{We have limited resources, traveller; we can only charge this leyline so many times before it destroys us. So go. Hurry to the Monolith before the testament vanishes...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_11_F	{OK, charge the leyline again; I’ll speed there now.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_11_F	{‘I envy you, Traveller! To see the words of Nal itself! Grah!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_11_F	{I can't do this at the moment.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_11_F	{‘You know not how important this is, how many of my people would kill us where we stood for even mentioning Nal's name...’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_11_S	{You approach the monolith. You are engulfed in its terrible truth. You see its words in the text of a thousand tongues, in the ephemera of countless stars.

You witness events that occurred millennia before your awakening. You see two Vy'keen standing before a red glow, asking it of the universe. You see a Gek and a Korvax, waiting side by side before you. And before the vision ends, you see a vision of something you have not seen before. Of something that does not belong in this or any place. Of hatred, grief, despair. Of something that is yet to come.

You see all this, and then it is over. The monolith has nothing more to show you.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_11_S	{Know that I heard the word of the Atlas where Hirk had heard nothing. In its rage, in its impotent jealousy, Hirk struck me from the mountain and I saw the truth of what the Monolith had said. That my end would be an awakening. That in this dream, nothing should perish. Or so it would be until the Travellers. So it would be until the destruction of realities. Know this, the final testament of Nal...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_11_S	{You leave, shaken by your experience.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_11_S	{As you go, you feel something right behind you, breathing, watching. When you turn it is gone.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_12	{The technician gives me the <TECHNOLOGY>Colossus Geobay<> schematic. 

The Vy'keen believe that their ancestor Hirk received wisdom from a Great Monolith, initiating a war against the Sentinels and slaying Nal the Objector.

The Monolith I discovered proves that this history is a lie. Nal was honoured with a vision whilst Hirk had been met with only silence, and in its jealousy Hirk murdered Nal. Yet I am left with questions.

I am left thinking of the creature I felt watching me. I am left with dread.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_12	{I -- thank you, Traveller. For this they call the followers of Nal 'heretics'?! Grah! With this discovery you have vindicated the actions of a thousand martyrs, Traveller. You deserve your reward: you deserve the Colossus, the largest Exocraft in my arsenal. Use it, and strike terror upon our enemies.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_12	{Accept the blueprint.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_12	{You take the blueprint, thanking the Technician for all they have done.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_13	{The technician waits anxiously to see my <TECHNOLOGY>Colossus Exocraft<> in its full glory. I watch as they forge an upgrade for my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Mining Laser<>, surrounded by schematics and charts.

They could have departed upon my discovery of the Monolith. Their heresy is now truth, and although there are those among the Vy'keen who will still pursue them, the Cultists of Nal will find themselves with new power in this galaxy. Yet still the technician has remained, promising to assist me as I assisted them, until such time as I no longer require their services.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_13	{I have transmitted Nal's testament to my brethren, Traveller. What you have learned this day will spread amongst the Vy'keen; it will change our people for the better. Grah! And if violence is required, so be it. You are not as pathetic as I once believed. You are no longer interloper. You are one of us, now until the end of time itself, enthroned in the glory of the Colossus.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_13	{I have built the Colossus Geobay.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_13	{‘Grah! Then why do you stand here, Traveller? Go! Subjugate this world with its power. Here is an Exocraft Vehicle Laser upgrade to assist with the task.’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_13	{I still need to build it.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_13	{‘Grah! You may be one of us, but you are still slow and pathetic!’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_14	{The technician requires more <SPECIAL>Nanite Clusters<> to create an upgrade for my <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft Signal Booster<>. 

Something is wrong. Some time ago I saw the Vy'keen with an image of their family, before they performed some ritual to erase such attachments from their mind. As I approach now, I see that same image. The technician stares at it, blinking for a few moments with an empty expression. When it notices me, it removes the photograph from the display. 

We do not speak of it again. I do not wish to awaken its pain.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_14	{I -- forgive me, Traveller, I am tired. I have almost exhausted the limits of my work, but soon you shall have mastery of this planet's signals and the speed with which to reach any threat. I require only sufficient <SPECIAL>Nanite Clusters<> to build the final blueprints. Grah! This employment has been one of glory!}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_14	{I have the Nanite Clusters.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_A_14	{The technician uses the Nanites to create their final Exocraft Signal Booster blueprint, handing it to you.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_B_14	{I don't have the substance you require.}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RES_B_14	{‘You will find them in abandoned structures, Traveller! Grah! Do not return to your former incompetence, I beg you...’}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_DESC_15	{The technician has a final reward: an <TECHNOLOGY>Acceleration Module<> upgrade for my Nomad Exocraft, once I have constructed its Geobay.

There are few in my travels that I have grown to understand as individuals, but this Vy'keen has shown me purposes, secrets I did not know existed in this universe. They have shown me the promise of a different future, of a time of strife and glory. The technician has struggled their entire life to achieve their goal of finding Nal's testament. What I head towards, I do not know...}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_LANG_15	{Here, Traveller: if you have constructed a Nomad Exocraft, this final <TECHNOLOGY>Acceleration Module<> shall be yours.

Our work is concluded, but every end is a beginning... I am too weak to travel as I once did, too tired to continue my pilgrimage. With your leave I shall remain here to stand by your side against your enemies. Grah! Woe betide those who would transgress against us!}
NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_OPT_A_15	{I possess the Nomad Exocraft.}

They spend their days doing this now, tending to the Exocraft and drawing data from interplanetary networks. Sometimes I see them walking out into the planet itself to explore, but such times are rare. The technician is content with this retirement, engaging in its fugitive activity for the pleasure of the chase, no longer for the necessity of survival.}

NPC_HIRE_VEHICLES_RECR_DESC_1	{The technician seeks work, claiming they will be able to build and upgrade <TECHNOLOGY>Exocraft<> for my travels.
 
When they see me, it is hard not to mistake the flash in their expression for panic, excitement, even. They quickly attempt to hide these emotions, painting their face with the contempt I have come to expect from this species. Yet I can tell, beyond all this, that they need me, spitting out words in my own language. That they fear for their life.}

EXP_TECHSHOP_DESC_1	{The lifeform offers me blueprints for Exosuit upgrades in exchange for Nanite Clusters.

Their facial lighting brightens as they see me. They produce multiple datapads, held with perfect balance from the tips of their silicon fingers.}
EXP_TECHSHOP_LANG_1	{An exchange: provide this entity with Nanite Clusters. Korvax Echo will grant blueprint exosuit upgrades for the lifeform's carapace. Inferior Gek and Vy'keen tech will lead to inevitable disconnection; buy safe, buy Korvax.}

They glare at me as I approach, trying to turn their grimace into a smile but failing even at this. They seem unhappy with their current position.}
