TOOL_SUB,{Lost Artifact}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Dusty and mudstained, this treasure is nonetheless an important historical artifact.}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_2,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This treasure clearly meant a lot to the people who buried it. Its value in the present day is perhaps more questionable.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Damaged by the damp and difficult conditions it was kept in for so long, this treasures shows few signs of its former splendor.}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_4,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This artifact appears to have suffered little from its years underground. Unfortunately, it does not appear to have been in very good condition before it was entombed.}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_COMMON_5,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Was this artifact part of a horde buried with its owner? The remains of a secret cache? Or just forgotten rubbish? Time has rendered it impossible to tell.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_UNCOMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Valuable in and of itself, this artifact is made by priceless the glimpse it gives into the society that once ruled this planet.}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_UNCOMMON_2,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. What caused this artifact's owner to bury it underground? Did they hope to return to claim it one day? Such questions may now never be answered.}
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_UNCOMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Crawling with insects and haunted by a musty aroma, this treasure is nonetheless an artifact of great worth.}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This rare treasure is covered in strange markings, as if the contents were used in some sort of rite or ritual.}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. There is an otherworldliness about this treasure, something strange in the way it catches the light. Almost as if it were haunted by its previous owner...}"
ITEMGEN_TREASURE_RARE_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This treasure bears the faint outline of a family crest. Perhaps its owner's descendants are out there somewhere, looking for this last trace of their ancestor...}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The paper is crumbling, the ink is fading. This may be the final opportunity anyone has to read this manuscript before time claims it for good.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Written in an otherworldly script, this manuscript is covered with strange marginalia. Generations have added notes and diagrams to the original text, some of which are highly disturbing.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The lettering is harsh and deeply carved. Whoever wrote this document left their emotions clearly engraved into the surface, regardless of the story the words are trying to tell.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_4,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This document is handwritten, its lettering shaky and weak. Whoever wrote this spent a great deal of energy - perhaps their last - to commit their words to history.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_COMMON_5,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Though the cover has been competently printed, the internal lettering is crude and juvenile. Perhaps this was merely a practise sheet, an exercise to improve their writing?}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Several of these pages appear stained, though there have been some clumsy attempts to clean them, and the second half has clearly been written in a different hand to the first...}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The original text of this document has been greatly altered. Entries have been crossed through, written over and even torn out, apparently by several different writers. Whatever was written here was hotly contested.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_UNCOMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This document was carefully packed in its container, wrapped in paper to keep it free of stains. There is a small bundle of hair clipped to the inside cover.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This manuscript is beautifully illustrated, with flowing calligraphy and dramatic, gilded illuminations. It is a work of exceptional artistry.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The text in this document does not seem to concern anything out of the ordinary. However, the letters themselves do appear to be written in blood.}"
ITEMGEN_HIST_RARE_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This manuscript is full of small, delicate blemishes. Tiny crinkled circles litter every page, as if the paper has been stained by tears.}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. There is a curious, sour aroma emanating from this sample. It is almost as if it has been slowly fermenting.}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. From the obvious care taken in delicately packing away this sample, one is forced to presume that the huge number of insect corpses that surrounded it were not present at the moment of burial.}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The sample, apparently dormant during its long confinement, has begun to slowly but definitely bubble, as if stirring into life...}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_4,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The sample is glowing faintly, a pale blue light flickering at its edge, barely visible in the daylight. What other secrets might a detailed analysis reveal?}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_COMMON_5,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This sample was found buried alongside with a hastily scrawled note. The language is long dead, but the panic in the writing is clear...}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This sample looks unnaturally clean, as if all other life that came into contact with it has been burned away.}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The sample has sprouted several additional 'samples', seedlings that have rapidly germinated and begun growing since their host was once again exposed to light and air.}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_UNCOMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. There are tatty labels all over this sample, stark pictograms as well as warnings in several languages. The labels, however, appear to be describing a predatory creature...}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_1,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This sample is still biologically active. It is releasing small puffs of gas on a remarkably regular cycle. The odour appears to change with each emission.}
ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The container used here is humdrum, hardly the sort of thing used to preserve a valuable specimen. And yet, this species hasn't been seen on this planet for centuries. What used to be widespread is now but a distant memory...}"
ITEMGEN_BIO_RARE_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. There is a layer of fine, medicinal-looking mould growing on the top of this sample. Nothing could go possibly wrong from 'testing' it...}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A well-preserved find, this fossil gives a glimpse of the strange creatures that used to roam this world.}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. It is difficult to be sure exactly what this fossil represents. Paleobiology is often a matter of guesswork and intuition, and certainties from our own era cannot be projected backwards in time.}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_3,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. It is impossible to look at this fossil without wondering what sort of life this creature lived and how it fitted it in the local ecosystem.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_4,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The remains of an apex predator, or the last fragments of some hunted prey? Sadly, time has rendered this sample difficult to draw conclusions from.}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_COMMON_5,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. What caused an ancient people to bury this box of bones? Were they part of a ritual? Were they currency? Toys? Or part of a museum gallery?}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Time has polished this fossil, giving it a pearlescent sheen, its surfacing shimmering in the light.}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A pristine find which, when analysed, will undoubtedly reveal much about the life and habits of the creature that left it behind.}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_UNCOMMON_3,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This fossil was already ancient before it was placed into storage by some long-lost civilisation. Its true age is unfathomable.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The remains of a truly strange being. This fragment, dead and decayed, offers only the merest glimpse of what must have been a magnificent sight in life.}"
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_2,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Whoever originally found and preserved this sample did so with enormous skill. There is enough viable DNA here to represent a potentially cloneable source.}
ITEMGEN_FOSSIL_RARE_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Though apparently the remains of some wild creature, there are indications that the animal had several close interactions with an agricultural society. Potentially, this sample is early evidence of domestication.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A relatively common plant, suffering from a relatively uncommon mutation. Spores of this size are not normal.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. The delicate scent and soft, fine hairs cannot disguise the fact this is a widespread weed. This was probably not what the original planet intended to grow.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A culinary delight, this plant was historically used to add flavour to meat past its prime. Despite being a fine seasoning, this sample is probably too historically significant to be eaten.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_4,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Great care should be taken to keep this sample from contaminating other habitats, particularly given the speed at which this plant appears to be spreading across its container.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_COMMON_5,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Beautiful in bloom, this ancient plant was traditionally used to convey a message of love and admiration.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This plant has remarkably poisonous leaves, highly toxic petals, and release a scent that causes mild intoxication. Handle with care.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Adorned with ripe, juicy berries, this plant looks highly nutritious. Even the stems, firm and fleshy, look like they'd be a delight to eat.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_UNCOMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A powerful medicinal herb, this plant could hold the key to developing the cure for the common cold. It should be deposited at a responsible cloning unit immediately.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A spectacular plant, once thought entirely extinct. It blooms rarely, and its precious flowers have inspired poetry, music and occasional murders.}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. When you stop to consider it, this plant's fragrance is subtle and hard to pin down. And yet, when your mind moves on to other things, the perfume grows in your mind, consuming your every thought, demanding your attention...}"
ITEMGEN_PLANT_RARE_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This sample is either suffering from, or the root of, a strange and severe mutation. It appears to be absorbing genetic material from anything it touches, twisting its tendrils to match the form of the donor.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Past its prime long before it was entombed, this tool was well-loved during its useful life. A family memento, perhaps, or a novice's training instrument?}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_2,{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A remarkable find. All the moreso for the fact the handle appears to be stained with a great quantity of organic matter...}
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. A pair of short words have been crudely engraved onto the surface of this tool. The owner's name, perhaps, or even the name of the object itself?}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_4,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This tool bears all the hallmarks of having been repaired several times over. Scorched in places from melting and reforging, its split materials bear witness to its long and hard life.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_COMMON_5,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. While this piece is clearly ancient, it is remarkable just how little it differs from the style used every day in the present age.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Buried alongside its schematic, this remarkable tool was perhaps an original prototype. More than just an object, this find represents the inventive drive in a raw and early form.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Covered in burn marks, this tool must have seen a very strange life. But buried beneath the earth, it has drifted so far from its original story that we may never know its true purpose.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_UNCOMMON_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Delicately made, the passing of time cannot hide the delicacy with which this tool was made. Possibly one of the finest examples of its type ever seen.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_1,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Buried with great care, this tool shows little sign of use. Perhaps it was an offering, made especially to be locked away from the physical world, its pristine nature emphasising how much this gesture meant to the burier.}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_2,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. This tool bears the marks of constant use, a well-loved piece before its burial. Was it consigned to the ground by accident? An afterthought? Or placed there carefully alongside a now departed owner?}"
ITEMGEN_TOOL_RARE_3,"{Approximately <VAL_ON>%AGE%<> years old. Bejewelled and dazzling, this tool has been decorated with countless precious stones. Augmented and audacious, this is a one-of-a-kind piece.}"
