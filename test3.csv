EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_1,"{As I approach the electronic being, it springs to life. From its dark mask, scanning beams emerge that envelop me. There is a unnerving chittering sound and then, unbelievably, it speaks in my language. It offers me a choice. It can show me how to harness black holes, in order to embark upon a journey to the centre of the galaxy. It can light my way to an Atlas Interface, so I may follow a path. Or it will assist me in my own exploration.}"
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_2,"{Nada, is, they reveal, a Korvax priest somehow freed of the group mind, now researching the origins of the galaxy. They express a bold theory - that our entire reality is something else's experiment. A simulation. I want to laugh, then I remember the Atlas. Nada offers me a choice again - or is it a test? Be returned to the fixed path of the Atlas. Find black holes to carry me to the galaxy's core. Or accept a gift to aid me in my own travels.}"
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_3,"{Nada's normally-restrained form is jittering and dancing, the external symptom of an internal struggle. Iridescent lights fluoresce across their visor. At times, another entity seems to stare out. I grasp their arm firmly, and soon a familiar light-pattern reasserts itself. The Korvax endlessly attempt to regain their errant shell and wipe Nada from existence. But the Priest Entity won't succumb until they have solved the riddle of reality.}"

There are repeating patterns all across the galaxy, identical elements where there should be endless divergence. This cannot be a coincidence. Did the Atlas do this? Across the room, Polo giggles.}"
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_5,"{Nada stays back from me this time. The lights dance across their visor like warning symbols. Something has changed between us. Nada explains that their reasoning has advanced. They have found no room in the galaxy for free will or anything but brutal causation. They worry we are but pawns of whatever higher being created us - puppets, dancing on strings. And Nada suspects me. I am the aberration. Am I the puppet-master too?}"
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_6,"{Nada's paranoia is infectious. I find myself spying into the room before I enter. The Gek, Polo, seems occupied, taking joy in their chores, but Nada's shell is static save for the dancing lights. Was... was that a flash of red behind the visor? If it was, it doesn't repeat. I wait a moment and enter loudly. Polo greets me effusively, but Nada and I are standoffish, our trust failing.}"
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_7,"{Nada and Polo are unusually quiet. Polo is elbow-deep in machinery, Nada in simulations, but the room is tense. It is clear that there has been a recent disagreement. Nada beckons me over. They express frustration over being tied to a machine body. But I am different - able to survive in so many ways, in so many places. I can go anywhere in this galaxy, be it in search of truth or to live my life as I see fit. Nada envies me, they admit.}"
EXP_NPC_ANOMALY_DESC_8,"{Nada stands close this time. If the being was capable of emotion, I'd say they were racked by it. They hesitantly rest a hand on my shoulder, and the visor moves close. I cannot see beneath the mask, but I feel that Nada is staring into my eyes. If I continue to the centre, this will be goodbye. Neither of us know if either will survive. If anything will survive. If freedom or destruction awaits us. Fearfully, sadly, Nada bades me farewell.}"
