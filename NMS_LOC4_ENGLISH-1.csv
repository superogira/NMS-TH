UI_GUIDE_BODY_SURVIVAL_BASICS,{<VAL_ON>Hazard Protection<> is vital if you plan to spend time away from your ship. Carry <COMMODITY>Sodium<> or <COMMODITY>Ion Batteries<>. Have a plan to find <VAL_ON>shelter in caves or structures<>. Many hazards are worse at night. Use the <TECHNOLOGY>Scanner<> (<IMG>SCAN<>) to locate resources. Nearby creatures marked with a <FUEL>Red Paw<> are predators and may be dangerous. Use your <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<> (<IMG>AIM<>) to identify them from afar (zoom with <IMG>ZOOM<>). Sentinels will not intervene if you attack a predator. The <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<> will also identify points of interest from afar. Use the Visor (<IMG>AIM<>) to locate buildings and supply caches. These locations are often rich in <VAL_ON>resources<> and <VAL_ON>information<>. The <VAL_ON>backpack icon<> in the bottom right shows inventory status. Not everything is immediately useful. Prioritise the materials to maintain your exosuit. Advanced products can always be found again. Acquire vital survival upgrades from <TECHNOLOGY>Technology Merchants<> on space stations and planetary shops.}
UI_GUIDE_BODY_SURVIVAL_1,"{Your exosuit's <VAL_ON>life support<> system must be kept powered to avoid user damage. Life support systems allow you to move around the planet. <VAL_ON>Sprinting<> (<IMG>RUN<>) and using the <VAL_ON>Jetpack<> (<IMG>JUMP<>) will drain life support power. Life support systems are recharged with <FUEL>Oxygen<>, <FUEL>Oxygen Capsules<> or <FUEL>Life Support Gel<>. <FUEL>Oxygen<> can be harvested from plants on every planet, and may be detected in other flora using the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<>. <FUEL>Oxygen Capsules<> can be crafted from <FUEL>Carbon<> and <FUEL>Oxygen<> and offer the most efficient way to carry life support power. When Oxygen is in short supply, <FUEL>Life Support Gel<> can be made in an emergency from <TECHNOLOGY>Di-hydrogen<>. Pressing <IMG>SCAN<> will activate the <VAL_ON>Scanner<>, locating nearby planetary <FUEL>Oxygen<>.

Basic suit protection may be extended with <TECHNOLOGY>technology upgrades<>. Away from shelter, hazard protection systems are recharged with <COMMODITY>Sodium<> or various <COMMODITY>Ion Batteries<>. <COMMODITY>Sodium<> can be harvested from planetary flora and is found on <VAL_ON>all worlds<>. Pressing <IMG>SCAN<> will activate the <VAL_ON>Scanner<>, locating nearby planetary <COMMODITY>Sodium<>. <COMMODITY>Ion Batteries<> can be crafted from <TECHNOLOGY>Cobalt<> and <EARTH>Ferrite<>.

UI_GUIDE_BODY_SURVIVAL_3,"{Locate nearby resources with the <TECHNOLOGY>Scanner<> (<IMG>SCAN<>). The key survival resources of <FUEL>Oxygen<>, <COMMODITY>Sodium<> and <TECHNOLOGY>Di-hydrogen<> are found on every planet. Most resources are harvested with your <VAL_ON>Mining Beam<>. Press <IMG>CYCLEWEAPON<> to cycle Multi-Tool mode, then <IMG>ATTACK<> to fire the laser. The Mining Beam requires <FUEL>organic elements<> for power. In the event of a fuel emergency, flora can be harvested for <FUEL>Carbon<> using <IMG>MELEE<>. Use the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<> (<IMG>AIM<>) to search for <VAL_ON>large mineral deposits<>, such as <STELLAR>Copper<>. These deposits can be refined into <STELLAR>Chromatic Metal<>, vital to many technologies. Upgrade the <TECHNOLOGY>Analysis Visor<> at <TECHNOLOGY>technology merchants<> allows it to reveal additional information, yielding <COMMODITY>extra resources<> when harvesting. Some resources require an <TECHNOLOGY>Advanced Mining Laser<> or <TECHNOLOGY>Haz-Mat Gauntlets<>.

Avoid harvesting while being observed.}"
UI_GUIDE_BODY_SURVIVAL_4,"{Multi-Tool, technology and survival systems consume power on use. Elements can be harvested directly, or found in shops and item caches in the form of <FUEL>Oxygen Capsules<> or <COMMODITY>Ion Batteries<>. <VAL_ON>Refined elements<> (eg <FUEL>Condensed Carbon<>) not only take up less space, but also provide greater charge to basic systems than common elements (eg <FUEL>Carbon<>). Advanced systems may require rarer or more refined elements to charge. Some buildings and components need to be <VAL_ON>repaired<> as well as fuelled. This may require more exotic resources.

Most structures can only be built in the <VAL_ON>vicinity of your base<>. Some, such as <TECHNOLOGY>Signal Boosters<>, can be built anywhere. Find <TECHNOLOGY>additional base parts<> in <TECHNOLOGY>Buried Technology Modules<>. Use the Analysis Visor (<IMG>AIM<>) and the <TECHNOLOGY>Terrain Manipulator<> to find buried parts. <VAL_ON>Specialist Terminals<> can be built in your base. <SPECIAL>Workers<> can be recruited from space stations to operate the terminal. They offer missions to research <TECHNOLOGY>advanced base parts and equipment<>. Whilst onboard space station, locate a <VAL_ON>Terminus Teleporter<> for teleportation to and from your base. The Terminus is on the left side of the space station, <VAL_ON>near the Mission Agent<>.}"

The <TECHNOLOGY>Signal Booster<> can be constructed to search for nearby buildings, as well as deciphering any <VAL_ON>navigational data<> you discover. <VAL_ON>Sprinting<> (<IMG>RUN<>) will allow you to travel faster for a short time, but will also <VAL_ON>drain your life support<> faster. The <TECHNOLOGY>Jetpack<> (<IMG>JUMP<>) can also be used to cover difficult terrain. The Jetpack recharges automatically while on the ground. The Jetpack can be used to <VAL_ON>scale cliffs<> even when uncharged. <VAL_ON>WARNING:<> Your jetpack can only be used in short bursts. Falling from great heights will cause damage. Save jetpack fuel to soften the impact.}"

For full details please see www.nomanssky.com. * Multiplayer: Team up a small team of friends and explore the universe together. * Visual Overhaul: The game is fully playable in third or first person, both on-foot and in ship. * Command Freighters: Assemble and upgrade a fleet of frigates and command them from the bridge of your freighter. * Unlimited Base Building: Bases can now be built anywhere on any planet. The universe has been regenerated to make room for the various changes and features being added. As a result, planetary biomes, terrain and lifeforms have been changed, and your location may also be slightly adjusted. Bases have been temporarily archived but can be restored at any base computer.
